<title>Identifying Rates</title>

<introduction>

<p>In <xref ref="section-graphing" /> we noticed that the increase between steps in data can be the same or change. Here we will explore more ways that data or functions can increase or decrease. </p>

</introduction>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-vary-difference">
	<title>Differences</title>

	<p>For linear data we noted that consecutive differences are always the same. In <xref ref="example-differences-quadratic" /> to <xref ref="example-differences-exponential" /> we will see known data and how the differences look.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-differences-quadratic">
		<title>Quadratic Data</title>

		<statement><p>Note in <xref ref="table-differences-quadratic" /> that the first differences are not the same. However, they increase in a suspiciously simple pattern. Checking the second differences (the differences of the 1st differences) we see a linear pattern. This turns out to be true for all quadratic data.</p></statement>

	<example xml:id="example-differences-exponential">
		<title>Exponential Data</title>

		<statement><p>In <xref ref="table-vary-exp-tien" /> we discovered that instead of having a fixed difference, the pairs have a fixed quotient (1.05 in that case). However, there is also a pattern in the differences.</p>
		<p>Notice that the differences are not the same (not linear). However, again we recognize a pattern, namely that the differences are exactly equal to the original data. The differences incorporating the original pattern is true of all exponentials.</p></statement>
	</example>

	<p>Generally it is easier to test if data is exponential by testing the ratios of terms rather than the differences.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-ratios-exponential">
		<title>Testing for Exponential</title>

		<statement><p>Notice that the differences are not the same as the orignal data as in <xref ref="table-differences-exponential" />. However we do notice that 20/9 is the first numerator over the second denominator. 80/27 is the second numerator over the third denominator. So we do see the pattern that the differences are built from the original data.</p>
		<p>The ratio (percent increase calculation) however is constant, so we can use that to easily recognize this data as exponential.</p></statement>

	<title>Inverse Relations</title>

	<p>In <xref ref="example-vary-ohm" /> we saw data where the increase in one variable caused a decrease in the other. That example is known as an inverse relation.</p>

		<title>Decreasing Exponential</title>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-variation-percent-mixture">
	<title>A Mixture Problem</title>

	<p>Here we will solve a mixture problem using percents, then consider how the result varies with respect to a parameter (total volume).</p>

	<p>The base problem is producing a isopropyl alcohol with a lower concentration of alcohol than the original solution. We begin with 16.0 oz of a 91.0% isopropyl alcohol solution. The other ingredient is water.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-dilute-alcohol">
		<title>Dilute Alcohol</title>

		<statement><p>Suppose we add 4.00 oz of water to this mixture. What will the percent alcohol be?</p></statement>
		<solution><p>The percent alcohol is the amount of alcohol divided by the total volume. The volume of alchol is <m>0.910(16.0)=14.6</m>. The volume of water from the original solution is <m>0.0900(16.0)=1.44</m>. We are adding 4.00 oz, thus the total volume is <m>16.0+4.00=20.0</m> oz. The final percent alcohol is <me>\frac{14.6}{20.0}=0.730</me> or 73.0%.</p></solution>
	</example>

	<p>If we added more water would the percent alcohol be greater or less? Note that if we are using all of the alcohol solution, the amount of water we add determines the percent alcohol.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-calculate-dilute">
		<title>Calcluate Dilution</title>

		<statement><p>Suppose we want 20.0 oz of 70.0% alcohol solution. How much water should we add? How much solution will we have?</p></statement>
		<solution><p>Because we are adding water, it will be easier to solve this by thinking about the percent water. Because isopropyl alcohol and water are the only two ingredients, the percent water is 100%-70%=30%. We know that we are starting with <m>0.0900 \cdot 16.0 = 1.44</m> oz of water and we want to end up with <m>0.300 \cdot 20.0 = 6.00</m> oz. This leads to the equation <me>1.44+W=6.00</me>. This means we need 4.56 oz of water.</p>
		<p>We can confirm this work by calculating the percent water. First note we have <m>16.0+4.56=20.56</m> oz of solution. The percent water then is <me>\frac{0.0900(16.0)+4.56}{16.0+4.56}=0.292</me>. Why is this not exactly 30%? That is the result of rounding with significant digits.</p></solution>
	</example>

	<p>By adding water we can of course not increase the percent alcohol, so 91% is the highest we can achieve. If we add enough water we can dilute it to as little as we want. That requires not restricting the final volume. This should make us wonder about a relationship between the desired volume and the minimum/maximum amount of alchol.</p>

	<p>This first question is the same as <xref ref="example-calculate-dilute" />. Use it to check your understanding of the process.</p>

	<exercise xml:id="exercise-calculate-dilute">
		<webwork>
			<statement>
				<p>If we start with 16.0 oz of 91.0% alcohol solution, how much water do we add to get 25.0 oz of a 55.0% alcohol solution? <var name="'9.81'" width="4" /></p>
				<p>How much solution total does this produce? Remember it is not necessarily 25.0 oz. <var name="'25.8'" width="4" /></p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>We want to end up with at least 25.0 oz of a solution that is 45.0% water. This means we want <m>0.450 \cdot 25.0 = 11.3</m> oz of water. We already have <m>0.0900 \cdot 16.0 = 1.44</m> oz of water. Thus we need to add <m>11.3-1.44 = 9.9</m> oz of water.</p>
				<p>Because we are adding 9.9 oz of water we have <m>16.0+9.9=25.9</m> oz of solution.</p>
			</solution>
	    </webwork>
	</exercise>

	<p>Next we will illustrate that for a desired volume, we cannot obtain every percent.</p>

	<exercise xml:id="exercise-calculate-dilute2">
		<webwork>
			<statement>
				<p>If we start with 16.0 oz of 91.0% alcohol solution, how much water do we add if we want 25.0 oz of a 60.0% alcohol solution? <var name="'8.56'" width="4" /></p>
				<p>How much solution total does this produce? <var name="'24.6'" width="4" /></p>
			</statement>
	    </webwork>
	</exercise>

	<p>Notice that we did not produce 25 oz but a little less. One question we can ask then is <q>what is the percent alcohol solution we can obtain for a given volume?</q></p>

	<example xml:id="example-calculate-exact-volume-dilute">
		<title>Exact Volume Dilution</title>

		<statement><p>If we start with 16.0 oz of 91.0% alcohol solution and we want exactly 20.0 oz of solution, what is the percent alcohol we can obtain?</p></statement>
		<solution><p>If we call the percent alcohol <m>P</m> then the percent water is <m>(1-P)</m>. Thus the final solution will have <me>(1-P)20.0 \text{ oz}</me> of water. We already have <me>0.0900 \cdot 16.0 = 1.44 \text{ oz}</me> of water. Thus we need <me>(1-P)20.0-1.44</me> oz of water. The total volume then will be <me>(1-P)20.0-1.44+16.0=20.0 \text{ oz}</me> Solving this tells us the percentage possible is
		<md>
			<mrow>(1-P)20.0-1.44+16.0 &amp; = 20.0</mrow>
			<mrow>(1-P)20.0 +14.6 &amp; = 20.0</mrow>
			<mrow>(1-P)20.0 &amp; = 5.4</mrow>
			<mrow>1-P &amp; = \frac{5.4}{20.0}</mrow>
			<mrow> -P &amp; = \frac{5.4}{20.0}-1</mrow>
			<mrow> P &amp; = 1-\frac{5.4}{20.0}</mrow>
			<mrow> P &amp; \approx 0.73</mrow>
		</md>
		Thus the percent we obtain for exactly 20.0 oz is 73%.</p></solution>

			</statement>
	    </webwork>
	</exercise>

	<exercise xml:id="exercise-exact-volume-variation">
