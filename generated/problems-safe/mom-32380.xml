<statement>
<p>Your friend Pat says to you, "I'm on a new diet plan and I've been able to lose about a pound a week." Come up with a linear equation that models this situation and use it to answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
If Pat currently weighs 245 pounds, how much would Pat weigh in a year (52 weeks)?</p>
<p>
<fillin characters="20" /> pounds</p>
<p>
Assuming Pat stays on this plan and the equation is still valid, how much would Pat weigh in 4 years?</p>
<p>
<fillin characters="20" /> pounds</p>
<p>
Does this equation still seem like it would be valid after 4 years? Why or why not?</p>

<solution>
<p><ul><li><p>193</p></li><li><p>37</p></li><li><p>Answers vary. You might say that it doesn't seem likely that Pat would weigh so little in 4 years, so the equation will probably no longer be valid.</p></li></ul></p>
