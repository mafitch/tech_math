<statement>
<p>Amanda rented a bike from Ted's Bikes. </p>
<p>It costs <dollar/>10 for the helmet plus <dollar/>5.25 per hour.</p>
<p>
If Amanda paid about <dollar/>49.38, how many hours did she rent the bike?</p>
<p>
a) Let <m>\displaystyle{h}</m> = the number of hours she rented the bike.  Write the equation you would use to solve this problem.</p>
<p>
<fillin characters="20" />
</p>
<p>
b) Now solve your equation</p>
<p>
Amanda rented the bike for <fillin characters="20" /> hours.
(Round your answer to the nearest tenth of an hour.)</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li><p><m>\displaystyle{5.25}\cdot{h}+{10}={49.38}</m></p></li><li><p>7.5</p></li></ul></p>
</solution>
