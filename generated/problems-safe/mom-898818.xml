<statement>
<p>Mr. Breuer is very proud of his hybrid vehicle, so he collected data about the number of gallons (x) at fill-up together with the number of miles (y) on that trip. The data is below:</p>
<table><tabular> 

<row>
<cell>gallons (x)</cell>
<cell>miles (y)</cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell>3.2</cell>
<cell>142</cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell>5.2</cell>
<cell>235</cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell>5.9</cell>
<cell>264</cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell>7</cell>
<cell>316</cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell>8.2</cell>
<cell>369</cell>
</row>

</tabular></table><p>On average, how many miles does Mr. Breuer get per gallon? (This would be the slope of the linear regression equation.) Round your answer to the nearest mile.</p>
<p><fillin characters="20" /> miles per gallon</p>
<p>If Mr. Breuer's vehicle holds 9 gallons, how many miles can he drive on a tank? Round your answer to the nearest mile.</p>
<p><fillin characters="20" /> miles</p>
