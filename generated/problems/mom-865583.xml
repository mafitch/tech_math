  Round to units. Do not type the <percent/></p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>34 <percent/></li></ul></p><p>A percent is a ratio written out of 100, so first we calculate the decimal version of the ratio. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{4703}}{{14000}}\approx{0.33592857142857}</m>. The percent version is <m>\displaystyle{33.592857142857}</m><percent/>. Finally we round to <m>\displaystyle{34}</m><percent/>.</p>
