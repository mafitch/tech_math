<statement>
<p>There are 14000 students attending the community college.  Find the percent of students that attend classes in the evening if there are 2991 evening students.</p>
<p><fillin characters="20"/> Â   <m>\displaystyle\%</m></p>
<p>
  Round to units. Do not type the <percent/></p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>21 <percent/></li></ul></p><p>A percent is a ratio written out of 100, so first we calculate the decimal version of the ratio. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{2991}}{{14000}}\approx{0.21364285714286}</m>. The percent version is <m>\displaystyle{21.364285714286}</m><percent/>. Finally we round to <m>\displaystyle{21}</m><percent/>.</p>
