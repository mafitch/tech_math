<solution>
<p><ul><li>53 <percent/></li></ul></p><p>A percent is a ratio written out of 100, so first we calculate the decimal version of the ratio. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{5852}}{{11000}}\approx{0.532}</m>. The percent version is <m>\displaystyle{53.2}</m><percent/>. Finally we round to <m>\displaystyle{53}</m><percent/>.</p>
