<p><fillin characters="20" /> Â   <m>\displaystyle\%</m></p>
<p>
  Round to units. Do not type the <percent/></p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>20 <percent/></li></ul></p><p>A percent is a ratio written out of 100, so first we calculate the decimal version of the ratio. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{3887}}{{19000}}\approx{0.20457894736842}</m>. The percent version is <m>\displaystyle{20.457894736842}</m><percent/>. Finally we round to <m>\displaystyle{20}</m><percent/>.</p>
