<statement>
<p>You need a 30<percent/> alcohol solution.  On hand, you have a 300 mL of a 40<percent/> alcohol mixture.  How much pure water will you need to add to obtain the desired solution?</p>
<p>
A)  Write an equation using the information as it is given above that can be used to solve this problem.  Use <m>\displaystyle{x}</m> as your variable to represent the amount of pure water you need to use.
Equation:  <fillin characters="30" />
</p>
<p>
B)  You will need </p>
<p>
<fillin characters="5" /> mL of pure water </p>
<p>
to obtain </p>
<p>
<fillin characters="5" /> mL of the desired 30<percent/> solution.</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li><p><m>\displaystyle{0.4}{\left({300}\right)}+{0}\cdot{x}={0.3}{\left({300}+{x}\right)}</m></p></li><li><p>100</p></li><li><p>400</p></li></ul></p>
