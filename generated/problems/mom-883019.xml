<statement>
<p>
You need a 75<percent/> alcohol solution.  On hand, you have a 975 mL of a 80<percent/> alcohol mixture.  How much pure water will you need to add to obtain the desired solution?</p>
<p>
A)  Write an equation using the information as it is given above that can be used to solve this problem.  Use <m>\displaystyle{x}</m> as your variable to represent the amount of pure water you need to use.
Equation:  <fillin characters="30" />
