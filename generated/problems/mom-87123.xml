<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{33.61}{x}+{22048}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{33.61}{x}+{22048}={75.21}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{22048}={41.6}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={530}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={75.21}\cdot{530}={39861.3}</m></p>
</solution>
