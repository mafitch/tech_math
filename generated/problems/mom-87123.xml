<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{32.64}{x}+{32417}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{32.64}{x}+{32417}={74.74}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{32417}={42.1}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={770}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={74.74}\cdot{770}={57549.8}</m></p>
</solution>
