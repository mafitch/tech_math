<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{22.84}{x}+{22825}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{22.84}{x}+{22825}={64.34}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{22825}={41.5}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={550}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={64.34}\cdot{550}={35387}</m></p>
</solution>
