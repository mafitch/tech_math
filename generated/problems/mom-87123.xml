<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{22.57}{x}+{20590}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{22.57}{x}+{20590}={58.07}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{20590}={35.5}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={580}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={58.07}\cdot{580}={33680.6}</m></p>
</solution>
