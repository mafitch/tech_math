<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{35.58}{x}+{31192}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{35.58}{x}+{31192}={91.28}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{31192}={55.7}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={560}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={91.28}\cdot{560}={51116.8}</m></p>
</solution>
