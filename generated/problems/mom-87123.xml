<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{42.86}{x}+{28458}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{42.86}{x}+{28458}={95.56}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{28458}={52.7}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={540}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={95.56}\cdot{540}={51602.4}</m></p>
</solution>
