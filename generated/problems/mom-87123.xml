A hoverboard manufacturer has just announced the <em>Glide 5</em> hoverboard. The accounting department has determined that  the cost to manufacturer the <em>Glide 5</em> hoverboard is <m>\displaystyle{y}={45.12}{x}+{31540}</m>.  The revenue equation is <m>\displaystyle{y}={86.62}{x}</m>.  What is the break even point for the <em>Glide 5</em> hoverboard?</p>

<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{45.12}{x}+{31540}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{45.12}{x}+{31540}={86.62}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{31540}={41.5}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={760}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={86.62}\cdot{760}={65831.2}</m></p>
</solution>
