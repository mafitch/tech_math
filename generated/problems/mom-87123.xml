<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{24.63}{x}+{17118}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{24.63}{x}+{17118}={56.33}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{17118}={31.7}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={540}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={56.33}\cdot{540}={30418.2}</m></p>
</solution>
