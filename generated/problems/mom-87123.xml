<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{25.11}{x}+{22365}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{25.11}{x}+{22365}={56.61}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{22365}={31.5}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={710}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={56.61}\cdot{710}={40193.1}</m></p>
</solution>
