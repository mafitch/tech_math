<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{45.61}{x}+{23359}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{45.61}{x}+{23359}={78.51}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{23359}={32.9}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={710}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={78.51}\cdot{710}={55742.1}</m></p>
</solution>
