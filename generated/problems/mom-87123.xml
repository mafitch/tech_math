A hoverboard manufacturer has just announced the <em>Glide 5</em> hoverboard. The accounting department has determined that  the cost to manufacturer the <em>Glide 5</em> hoverboard is <m>\displaystyle{y}={24.87}{x}+{35742}</m>.  The revenue equation is <m>\displaystyle{y}={76.67}{x}</m>.  What is the break even point for the <em>Glide 5</em> hoverboard?</p>

<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{24.87}{x}+{35742}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{24.87}{x}+{35742}={76.67}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{35742}={51.8}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={690}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={76.67}\cdot{690}={52902.3}</m></p>
</solution>
