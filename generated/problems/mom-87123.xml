<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{33.48}{x}+{30149}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{33.48}{x}+{30149}={84.58}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{30149}={51.1}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={590}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={84.58}\cdot{590}={49902.2}</m></p>
</solution>
