A hoverboard manufacturer has just announced the <em>Glide 5</em> hoverboard. The accounting department has determined that  the cost to manufacturer the <em>Glide 5</em> hoverboard is <m>\displaystyle{y}={22.64}{x}+{30044}</m>.  The revenue equation is <m>\displaystyle{y}={74.44}{x}</m>.  What is the break even point for the <em>Glide 5</em> hoverboard?</p>

<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{22.64}{x}+{30044}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{22.64}{x}+{30044}={74.44}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{30044}={51.8}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={580}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={74.44}\cdot{580}={43175.2}</m></p>
</solution>
