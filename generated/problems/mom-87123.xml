<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{35.17}{x}+{36103}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{35.17}{x}+{36103}={80.87}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{36103}={45.7}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={790}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={80.87}\cdot{790}={63887.3}</m></p>
</solution>
