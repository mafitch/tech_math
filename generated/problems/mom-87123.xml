<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{45.77}{x}+{22152}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{45.77}{x}+{22152}={88.37}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{22152}={42.6}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={520}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={88.37}\cdot{520}={45952.4}</m></p>
</solution>
