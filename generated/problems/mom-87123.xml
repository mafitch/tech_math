<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{44.46}{x}+{42813}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{44.46}{x}+{42813}={108.36}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{42813}={63.9}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={670}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={108.36}\cdot{670}={72601.2}</m></p>
</solution>
