<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{44.57}{x}+{20473}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{44.57}{x}+{20473}={79.27}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{20473}={34.7}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={590}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={79.27}\cdot{590}={46769.3}</m></p>
</solution>
