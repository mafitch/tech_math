<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{41.79}{x}+{35844}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{41.79}{x}+{35844}={103.59}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{35844}={61.8}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={580}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={103.59}\cdot{580}={60082.2}</m></p>
</solution>
