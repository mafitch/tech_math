<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{23.42}{x}+{42315}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{23.42}{x}+{42315}={88.52}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{42315}={65.1}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={650}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={88.52}\cdot{650}={57538}</m></p>
</solution>
