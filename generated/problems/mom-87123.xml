<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{21.72}{x}+{19305}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{21.72}{x}+{19305}={56.82}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{19305}={35.1}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={550}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={56.82}\cdot{550}={31251}</m></p>
</solution>
