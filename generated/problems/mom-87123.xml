<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{21.42}{x}+{25764}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{21.42}{x}+{25764}={66.62}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{25764}={45.2}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={570}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={66.62}\cdot{570}={37973.4}</m></p>
</solution>
