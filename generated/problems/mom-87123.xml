<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{24.43}{x}+{41192}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{24.43}{x}+{41192}={78.63}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{41192}={54.2}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={760}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={78.63}\cdot{760}={59758.8}</m></p>
</solution>
