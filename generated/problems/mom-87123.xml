A hoverboard manufacturer has just announced the <em>Glide 5</em> hoverboard. The accounting department has determined that  the cost to manufacturer the <em>Glide 5</em> hoverboard is <m>\displaystyle{y}={24.25}{x}+{26432}</m>.  The revenue equation is <m>\displaystyle{y}={65.55}{x}</m>.  What is the break even point for the <em>Glide 5</em> hoverboard?</p>

<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{24.25}{x}+{26432}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{24.25}{x}+{26432}={65.55}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{26432}={41.3}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={640}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={65.55}\cdot{640}={41952}</m></p>
</solution>
