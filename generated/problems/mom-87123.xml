<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{35.81}{x}+{49248}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{35.81}{x}+{49248}={100.61}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{49248}={64.8}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={760}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={100.61}\cdot{760}={76463.6}</m></p>
</solution>
