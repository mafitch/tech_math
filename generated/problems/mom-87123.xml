<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{41.64}{x}+{20096}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{41.64}{x}+{20096}={73.04}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{20096}={31.4}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={640}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={73.04}\cdot{640}={46745.6}</m></p>
</solution>
