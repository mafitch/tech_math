<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{43.66}{x}+{32412}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{43.66}{x}+{32412}={88.06}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{32412}={44.4}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={730}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={88.06}\cdot{730}={64283.8}</m></p>
</solution>
