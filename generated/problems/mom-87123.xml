<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{21.81}{x}+{37944}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{21.81}{x}+{37944}={74.51}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{37944}={52.7}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={720}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={74.51}\cdot{720}={53647.2}</m></p>
</solution>
