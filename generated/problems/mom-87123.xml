<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{23.75}{x}+{21879}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{23.75}{x}+{21879}={66.65}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{21879}={42.9}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={510}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={66.65}\cdot{510}={33991.5}</m></p>
</solution>
