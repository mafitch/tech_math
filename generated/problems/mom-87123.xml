A hoverboard manufacturer has just announced the <em>Glide 5</em> hoverboard. The accounting department has determined that  the cost to manufacturer the <em>Glide 5</em> hoverboard is <m>\displaystyle{y}={22.25}{x}+{17010}</m>.  The revenue equation is <m>\displaystyle{y}={53.75}{x}</m>.  What is the break even point for the <em>Glide 5</em> hoverboard?</p>

<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{22.25}{x}+{17010}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{22.25}{x}+{17010}={53.75}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{17010}={31.5}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={540}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={53.75}\cdot{540}={29025}</m></p>
</solution>
