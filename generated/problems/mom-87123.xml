<p>
The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system using substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{45.21}{x}+{32832}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{45.21}{x}+{32832}={90.81}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{32832}={45.6}{x}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{x}={720}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for y</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{y}={90.81}\cdot{720}={65383.2}</m></p>
</solution>
