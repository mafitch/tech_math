<statement>
<p>A thyroid peroxidase antibody test was performed on a 45 year old man. The dilution sequence was 55 <m>\displaystyle\mu{L}</m> serum added to 165 <m>\displaystyle\mu{L}</m> of diluent in tube 1. Then 50 <m>\displaystyle\mu{L}</m> from tube 1 was added to 350 <m>\displaystyle\mu{L}</m> of diluent in tube 2. Finally 30 <m>\displaystyle\mu{L}</m> from tube 2 was added to 180 <m>\displaystyle\mu{L}</m> of diluent in tube 3.</p>
<p>All dilution ratios should be given as fractions. </p>
<p>a.) What is the dilution ratio in tube 1? </p>
<p><fillin characters="20" />   </p>
<p>b.) What is the dilution ratio in tube 2?</p>
<p><fillin characters="20" />   </p>
<p>c.) What is the dilution ratio in tube 3?</p>
<p><fillin characters="20" />   </p>
<p>d.) What is the overall (serial) dilution ratio?</p>
<p><fillin characters="20" />   </p>
