<statement>
<p>
The radiator in a car is filled with a solution of 75 per cent
antifreeze and 25 per cent water.  The manufacturer of the
antifreeze suggests that for summer driving, optimal cooling of the
engine is obtained with only 50 per cent antifreeze.
</p>
<p>
If the capacity of the radiator is 4.3 liters, how much coolant (in liters) must be
drained and replaced with pure water to reduce the antifreeze
concentration to 50 per cent?
</p>
<p>
Round your answer to two significant figures.
