<statement>
<p>The radiator in a car is filled with a solution of 75<percent/> antifreeze and 25<percent/> water.  The manufacturer of the antifreeze suggests that for summer driving, optimal cooling of the engine is obtained with only 50<percent/> antifreeze.</p>
<p>If the capacity of the radiator is 3 liters, how much coolant (in liters) must be drained and replaced with pure water to reduce the antifreeze concentration to 50<percent/>? Round to the nearest hundredth of a liter. <input type="text" style="width:5.8ch" name="qn0" id="qn0" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1" class="text"/> L</p>

<solution>
<p><ul><li>1</li></ul></p><p>This is a percent problem. We know the percent that is originally antifreeze (75<percent/>) and the percent we want (50<percent/>). Let's call the amount to drain <m>\displaystyle{d}</m> (in liters). The amount of antifreeze after we drain is <m>\displaystyle{\left({0.75}\right)}{\left({3}-{d}\right)}</m>. This will be the same as the amount after we add water which is <m>\displaystyle{0.5}{\left({3}\right)}</m>. Thus we can solve <m>\displaystyle{\left({0.75}\right)}{\left({3}-{d}\right)}={0.5}{\left({3}\right)}</m>. The solution is <m>\displaystyle{d}={1}</m>. Rounding (because we can only measure so precisely) gives us 1 L.</p>
