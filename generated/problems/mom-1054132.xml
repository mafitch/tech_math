<statement>
<p>
A native wolf species has been reintroduced into a national forest.  Originally 450 wolves were transplanted, and after 3 years the population had grown to 643 wolves.  If the population grows exponentially according to the formula <m>\displaystyle{P}_{{t}}={P}_{{{0}}}{\left({1}+{r}\right)}^{{t}}</m></p>
<p>
(a) Find the growth rate.  Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a percent.</p>
<p>
r = <fillin characters="20" /><percent/></p>
<p>
(b) If this trend continues, how many wolves will there be in ten years?</p>
<p>
<fillin characters="20" /> wolves</p>
<p>
(c) If this trend continues, how long will it take for the population to grow to 1000 wolves?  Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a year.</p>
<p>
<fillin characters="20" /> years
