<statement>
<p>In 22 <percent/> of the last 50 days it rained. How many days did it not rain? <fillin characters="20" /> days</p>
<p><em>Round to the nearest whole.</em></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>39</li></ul></p><p>We recall that a percent as a decimal is part/whole. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{P}}{{50}}={0.22}</m>. We solve for P by multiplying by <m>\displaystyle{50}</m>. <m>\displaystyle{P}={0.22}\cdot{50}={11}</m>. We round that as requested to 11 to find the days it rained. How many days did it NOT rain?</p>
