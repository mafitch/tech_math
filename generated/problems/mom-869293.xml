<statement>
<p>In 32.14 <percent/> of the last 28 days it rained. How many days did it not rain? <fillin characters="20" /> days</p>
<p><em>Round to the nearest whole.</em></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>19</li></ul></p><p>We recall that a percent as a decimal is part/whole. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{P}}{{28}}={0.3214}</m>. We solve for P by multiplying by <m>\displaystyle{28}</m>. <m>\displaystyle{P}={0.3214}\cdot{28}={8.9992}</m>. We round that as requested to 9 to find the days it rained. How many days did it NOT rain?</p>
