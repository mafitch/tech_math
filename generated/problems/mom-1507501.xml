<statement>
<p>Gravel is piled in the shape of a cone. The circumference of the base is 100.5 feet. The slant height is 65.0 feet. Find the volume of gravel.</p>
<p>Use the rules for working with measurements to give your answer to the appropriate level of accuracy or precision.</p>
<p><fillin characters="5" /> <m>\displaystyle\text{ft}^{{3}}</m></p>
<p>If the gravel weighs <m>\displaystyle{3},{200}\frac{\text{lb}}{\text{yd}^{{3}}}</m>, how many 25-ton truckloads are needed to transport the gravel? Think about what the appropriate rounding would be for the number of truckloads.</p>
<p><fillin characters="5" /> truckloads.</p>
<p>It may be useful to know the following:</p>
<p>
  3 feet = 1 yard</p>
<p>
  2000 lb = 1 ton</p>
