<p>The force <m>\displaystyle{F}</m> (in pounds) needed on a wrench handle to loosen a certain bolt varies inversely with the length <m>\displaystyle{L}</m> (in inches) of the handle. A force of 50 pounds is needed when the handle is 4.0 inches long. If a person needs 20 pounds of force to loosen the bolt, estimate the length of the wrench handle. Round answer to two decimal places if necessary.</p>
