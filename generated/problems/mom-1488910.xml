<statement>
<p>At a particular airport the angle of depression flown by aircraft following the visual descent angle (VDA) is <m>\displaystyle{2.87}^{\circ}</m>. This leads to a point 1020 ft from the threshold of the runway. How high is the aircraft at the threshold? <input type="text" style="width:5.8ch" name="qn0" id="qn0" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1" class="text"/></p>
