<statement>
<p>
In certain deep parts of oceans, the pressure of sea water, <m>\displaystyle{P},</m> in pounds per square foot, at a depth of <m>\displaystyle{d}</m> feet below the surface, is given by the following equation:</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{P}={14}+\frac{{{4}{d}}}{{13}}</m></p>
<p>
If a scientific team uses special equipment to measures the pressure under water and finds it to be 178 pounds per square foot, at what depth is the team making their measurements?</p>
<p>
Answer: The team is measuring at <input type="text" style="width:8.2ch" name="qn0" id="qn0" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1" class="text"/> feet below the surface.
