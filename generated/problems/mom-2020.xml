<statement>
<p>In certain deep parts of oceans, the pressure of sea water, <m>\displaystyle{P},</m> in pounds per square foot, at a depth of <m>\displaystyle{d}</m> feet below the surface, is given by the following equation:</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{P}={14}+\frac{{{8}{d}}}{{13}}</m></p>
<p>
If a scientific team uses special equipment to measures the pressure under water and finds it to be 414 pounds per square foot, at what depth is the team making their measurements?</p>
<p>
Answer: The team is measuring at <fillin characters="6" /> feet below the surface.</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>650 feet</p>
