<statement>
<p>
In 1991, the moose population in a park was measured to be 3850.  By 1998, the population was measured again to be 4270.  If the population continues to change linearly:</p>
<p>
Find a formula for the moose population, <m>\displaystyle{P}</m>, in terms of <m>\displaystyle{t}</m>, the years since 1990.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{P}{\left({t}\right)}=</m> <fillin characters="20" />

<p>
What does your model predict the moose population to be in 2007?</p>
