<statement>
<p>A man owns stock valued at <dollar/>2,200.00.  One day the stock drops by 7<percent/>, and the next day the gain is the same percentage.  How much money is the stock valued at the end of the second day? <dollar/><fillin characters="4"/> </p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>2,189.22</li></ul></p><p>We can calculate in two steps. First, the decrease on the first day is <m>\displaystyle\${2},{200.00}\cdot{0.07}=\${154.00}</m>. This means the value at the end of day 1 is <m>\displaystyle\${2},{200.00}-\${154.00}=\${2},{046.00}</m>.</p>
<p>Second the increase on the second day is <m>\displaystyle\${2},{046.00}\cdot{0.07}=\${143.22}</m>. Notice that we are calculating the percent based on the first days result, not the original amount. The amount at the end of the second day is <m>\displaystyle\${2},{046.00}+\${143.22}=\${2},{189.22}</m>.</p>
