<statement>
<p>A man owns stock valued at <dollar/>2,300.00.  One day the stock drops by 9<percent/>, and the next day the gain is the same percentage.  How much money is the stock valued at the end of the second day? <dollar/><fillin characters="4"/> </p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>2,281.37</li></ul></p><p>We can calculate in two steps. First, the decrease on the first day is <m>\displaystyle\${2},{300.00}\cdot{0.09}=\${207.00}</m>. This means the value at the end of day 1 is <m>\displaystyle\${2},{300.00}-\${207.00}=\${2},{093.00}</m>.</p>
<p>Second the increase on the second day is <m>\displaystyle\${2},{093.00}\cdot{0.09}=\${188.37}</m>. Notice that we are calculating the percent based on the first days result, not the original amount. The amount at the end of the second day is <m>\displaystyle\${2},{093.00}+\${188.37}=\${2},{281.37}</m>.</p>
