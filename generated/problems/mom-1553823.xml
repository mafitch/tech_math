<statement>
<p>A man owns stock valued at <dollar/>2,700.00.  One day the stock drops by 9<percent/>, and the next day the gain is the same percentage.  How much money is the stock valued at the end of the second day? <dollar/><fillin characters="4"/> </p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>2,678.13</li></ul></p><p>We can calculate in two steps. First, the decrease on the first day is <m>\displaystyle\${2},{700.00}\cdot{0.09}=\${243.00}</m>. This means the value at the end of day 1 is <m>\displaystyle\${2},{700.00}-\${243.00}=\${2},{457.00}</m>.</p>
<p>Second the increase on the second day is <m>\displaystyle\${2},{457.00}\cdot{0.09}=\${221.13}</m>. Notice that we are calculating the percent based on the first days result, not the original amount. The amount at the end of the second day is <m>\displaystyle\${2},{457.00}+\${221.13}=\${2},{678.13}</m>.</p>
