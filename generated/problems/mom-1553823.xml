<statement>
<p>A man owns stock valued at <dollar/>2,500.00.  One day the stock drops by 8<percent/>, and the next day the gain is the same percentage.  How much money is the stock valued at the end of the second day? <dollar/><input type="text" style="width:5.8ch" name="qn0" id="qn0" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1" class="text"/> </p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>2,484.00</li></ul></p><p>We can calculate in two steps. First, the decrease on the first day is <m>\displaystyle\${2},{500.00}\cdot{0.08}=\${200.00}</m>. This means the value at the end of day 1 is <m>\displaystyle\${2},{500.00}-\${200.00}=\${2},{300.00}</m>.</p>
<p>Second the increase on the second day is <m>\displaystyle\${2},{300.00}\cdot{0.08}=\${184.00}</m>. Notice that we are calculating the percent based on the first days result, not the original amount. The amount at the end of the second day is <m>\displaystyle\${2},{300.00}+\${184.00}=\${2},{484.00}</m>.</p>
