<statement>
<p>The length of the near field of an ultrasonic tester is given by <m>\displaystyle{L}=\frac{{D}^{{2}}}{{{4}\lambda}}</m> where <m>\displaystyle{D}</m> is the diameter of the transducer (depends on crystal size) and <m>\displaystyle\lambda</m> is the wavelength. If <m>\displaystyle{D}={0.011}</m> and the wavelength is <m>\displaystyle\lambda={662.5}</m> in glass, what is the length of the near field? <fillin characters="20" /> Â  </p>
