<statement>
<p>In the graph below the input <m>\displaystyle{x}</m> is the number of units produced by a machine in a factory. The output <m>\displaystyle{y}</m> is the profit made by the sale of these units when they are produced. Determine the intercepts and interpret the meaning of each.</p>
<image width="83%"  pi:generated="problems/images/a153eae0bd748c7d84afee92e22e9f8c.png" />
<p><em>A</em>. Give the coordinates of the <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>-intercept: <fillin characters="20" /></p>
<p><em>B</em>. Interpret the meaning of the <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>-intercept: </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>The profit is zero when 80 units are produced and sold.</li> 
<li>There are zero units produced and sold when the profit is <dollar/>80.</li> 
<li>The profit is <dollar/>80 when -70 display units are produced and sold.</li> 
<li>There are zero units produced and sold when the profit is <dollar/>-70</li> 
<li>The profit is <dollar/>-70 when 80 display units are produced and sold</li> 
<li>The profit is zero when -70 units are produced and sold.</li> 
</ol></p>
<p><em>C</em>. Give the coordinates of the <m>\displaystyle{y}</m>-intercept: <fillin characters="20" /></p>
<p><em>D</em>. Interpret the meaning of the <m>\displaystyle{y}</m>-intercept: </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>The profit is <dollar/>-70 when zero units are produced.</li> 
<li>The profit is zero when 80 units are produced and sold.</li> 
<li>There are zero units produced and sold when the profit is <dollar/>80.</li> 
<li>The profit is <dollar/>-70 when 80 display units are produced and sold</li> 
<li>The profit is <dollar/>80 when -70 display units are produced and sold.</li> 
<li>The profit is zero when -70 units are produced and sold.</li> 
</ol></p>
<p><em>E</em>. Determine the slope of the line: <fillin characters="20" />                 <lbracket/>Make sure your slope is written as a reduced fraction.<rbracket/></p>
<p><em>F</em>. Interpret the meaning of the slope. For each 4-unit increase in units sold there is a(n) </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>decrease</li> 
<li>increase</li>
