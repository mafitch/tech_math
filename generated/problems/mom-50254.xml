<statement>
<p>In the graph below the input <m>\displaystyle{x}</m> is the number of units produced by a machine in a factory. The output <m>\displaystyle{y}</m> is the profit made by the sale of these units when they are produced. Determine the intercepts and interpret the meaning of each.</p>

<p><em>A</em>. Give the coordinates of the <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>-intercept: <fillin characters="20" /></p>
<p><em>B</em>. Interpret the meaning of the <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>-intercept: </p>
<p><ul label="circle"><li><p>The profit is zero when 50 units are produced and sold.</p></li> 
<li><p>The profit is zero when -160 units are produced and sold.</p></li> 
<li><p>There are zero units produced and sold when the profit is <dollar/>50.</p></li> 
<li><p>The profit is <dollar/>-160 when 50 display units are produced and sold</p></li> 
<li><p>There are zero units produced and sold when the profit is <dollar/>-160</p></li> 
<li><p>The profit is <dollar/>50 when -160 display units are produced and sold.</p></li> 
</ul></p>
<p><em>C</em>. Give the coordinates of the <m>\displaystyle{y}</m>-intercept: <fillin characters="20" /></p>
<p><em>D</em>. Interpret the meaning of the <m>\displaystyle{y}</m>-intercept: </p>
<p><ul label="circle"><li><p>There are zero units produced and sold when the profit is <dollar/>50.</p></li> 
<li><p>The profit is <dollar/>50 when -160 display units are produced and sold.</p></li> 
<li><p>The profit is <dollar/>-160 when 50 display units are produced and sold</p></li> 
<li><p>The profit is zero when 50 units are produced and sold.</p></li> 
<li><p>The profit is <dollar/>-160 when zero units are produced.</p></li> 
<li><p>The profit is zero when -160 units are produced and sold.</p></li> 
</ul></p>
<p><em>E</em>. Determine the slope of the line: <fillin characters="20" />              <lbracket/>Make sure your slope is written as a reduced fraction.<rbracket/></p>
<p><em>F</em>. Interpret the meaning of the slope. For each 6-unit increase in units sold there is a(n) </p>
<p><ul label="circle"><li><p>decrease</p></li> 
<li><p>increase</p></li> 
</ul></p>
 in profit of <dollar/><fillin characters="20" />.  Round your answer to the nearest cent.
