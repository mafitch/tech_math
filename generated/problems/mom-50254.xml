<statement>
<p>In the graph below the input <m>\displaystyle{x}</m> is the number of units produced by a machine in a factory. The output <m>\displaystyle{y}</m> is the profit made by the sale of these units when they are produced. Determine the intercepts and interpret the meaning of each.</p>

<p><em>A</em>. Give the coordinates of the <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>-intercept: <fillin characters="20" /></p>
<p><em>B</em>. Interpret the meaning of the <m>\displaystyle{x}</m>-intercept: </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>The profit is zero when 70 units are produced and sold.</li> 
<li>The profit is <dollar/>-50 when 70 display units are produced and sold</li> 
<li>There are zero units produced and sold when the profit is <dollar/>70.</li> 
<li>The profit is zero when -50 units are produced and sold.</li> 
<li>The profit is <dollar/>70 when -50 display units are produced and sold.</li> 
<li>There are zero units produced and sold when the profit is <dollar/>-50</li> 
</ol></p>
<p><em>C</em>. Give the coordinates of the <m>\displaystyle{y}</m>-intercept: <fillin characters="20" /></p>
<p><em>D</em>. Interpret the meaning of the <m>\displaystyle{y}</m>-intercept: </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>The profit is <dollar/>-50 when 70 display units are produced and sold</li> 
<li>The profit is <dollar/>70 when -50 display units are produced and sold.</li> 
<li>The profit is zero when -50 units are produced and sold.</li> 
<li>The profit is <dollar/>-50 when zero units are produced.</li> 
<li>The profit is zero when 70 units are produced and sold.</li> 
<li>There are zero units produced and sold when the profit is <dollar/>70.</li> 
</ol></p>
<p><em>E</em>. Determine the slope of the line: <fillin characters="20" />              <lbracket/>Make sure your slope is written as a reduced fraction.<rbracket/></p>
<p><em>F</em>. Interpret the meaning of the slope. For each 17-unit increase in units sold there is a(n) </p>

<li>decrease</li> 
</ol></p>
 in profit of <dollar/><fillin characters="20" />.  Round your answer to the nearest cent. 
<p><em>G</em>. Write the equation of the line in <m>\displaystyle{y}={m}{x}+{b}</m> form: <fillin characters="20" />Preview Question 1 Part 8 of 9  
</p>
<p><em>H</em>. Use your equation to determine what quantity of units will yield a profit of <dollar/>-30: <fillin characters="20" /></p>
