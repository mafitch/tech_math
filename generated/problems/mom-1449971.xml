<p>The dilution factor is defined to be grams of solute per mL of solution resulting. We have 25 g of solute in 50 mL of diluent, so the ratio is 25/50. Sometimes it is written as simply 50. Note, this matches dilution ratio because the solute adds almost no volume to the solution (too small to measure).</p>
<p>The percent concentration is defined to be grams of solute per mL of solution resulting written as a percent. We have 25 g of solute in 50 mL of diluent, so the percent is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{25}}{{50}}\cdot{100}={50}\%</m>.</p>
