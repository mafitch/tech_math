<p>The dilution ratio is defined to be grams of solute per mL of diluent added. We have 9 g of solute with 2000 mL of diluent added, so the ratio is 9/2000.</p>
<p>The dilution factor is defined to be grams of solute per mL of solution resulting. We have 9 g of solute in 2000 mL of diluent, so the ratio is 9/2000. Sometimes it is written as simply 2000. Note, this matches dilution ratio because the solute adds almost no volume to the solution (too small to measure).</p>
<p>The percent concentration is defined to be grams of solute per mL of solution resulting written as a percent. We have 9 g of solute in 2000 mL of diluent, so the percent is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{9}}{{2000}}\cdot{100}={0.45}\%</m>.</p>
