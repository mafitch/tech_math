<p>The dilution ratio is defined to be grams of solute per mL of diluent added. We have 35 g of solute with 100 mL of diluent added, so the ratio is 35/100.</p>
<p>The dilution factor is defined to be grams of solute per mL of solution resulting. We have 35 g of solute in 100 mL of diluent, so the ratio is 35/100. Sometimes it is written as simply 100. Note, this matches dilution ratio because the solute adds almost no volume to the solution (too small to measure).</p>
<p>The percent concentration is defined to be grams of solute per mL of solution resulting written as a percent. We have 35 g of solute in 100 mL of diluent, so the percent is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{35}}{{100}}\cdot{100}={35}\%</m>.</p>
