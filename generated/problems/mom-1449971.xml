<p>The dilution factor is defined to be grams of solute per mL of solution resulting. We have 250 g of solute in 5 mL of diluent, so the ratio is 250/5. Sometimes it is written as simply 5. Note, this matches dilution ratio because the solute adds almost no volume to the solution (too small to measure).</p>
<p>The percent concentration is defined to be grams of solute per mL of solution resulting written as a percent. We have 250 g of solute in 5 mL of diluent, so the percent is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{250}}{{5}}\cdot{100}={5000}\%</m>.</p>
