<p>Albuterol is a medicine used for treating asthma. It comes in an inhaler that contains 17 mg of albuterol mixed with a liquid. One actuation (inhalation) from the mouthpieces delivers a 90 <m>\displaystyle\mu{g}</m> dose of albuterol. (Reminder: 1 mg = 1000 <m>\displaystyle\mu{g}</m> .) </p>
<p>a.) Dr. Olson orders 2 inhalations 6 times per day. How many micrograms of albuterol does the patient inhale per day?</p>

<p>c.) Madison is going away for 7 months and wants to take enough albuterol to last for that time. Her physician has prescribed 2 inhalations 6 times per day. How many inhalers will Madison need to take with her for the 7 period? Assume 30-day months.</p>
<p><em>Hint: she can't bring a fraction of an inhaler, and she does not want to run out of medicine while away.</em></p>
