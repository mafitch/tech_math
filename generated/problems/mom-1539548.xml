<p>When a gas tank, which is a rectangular prism, is not level with the ground, a portion of the tank will not be able to be filled because it is higher than the hole through which the fuel comes. In the image above this is the area above the (blue) line at the top, right side of the tank.</p>
<p>Suppose this tank has the filler hole <m>\displaystyle{d}={6}</m> in from the front edge of the tank, and the width of the tank is 42 in (this is the dimension not shown in the image). If the angle is <m>\displaystyle\alpha={2}^{\circ}</m>, the unfillable portion has what volume in gallons? <input type="text" style="width:5.8ch" name="qn0" id="qn0" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1" class="text"/></p>
<p>There are 231 cubic inches per gallon. Round to the nearest hundreth of a gallon.</p>
