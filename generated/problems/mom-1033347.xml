<statement>
<p>Your friend Juliana and you decide to order a pizza and are debating between ordering a medium, which costs <dollar/>12.99, versus a large, which costs <dollar/>15.99. Since you know geometry, you decided to math this out.</p>
<p>Here are the medium (left) and large (right) pizzas.</p>

<p>The diameter of the large pizza is <fillin characters="4" />    times as large as the medium pizza.</p>
<p>What is the area of the medium pizza? Round your answer to the nearest tenth. <fillin characters="4" />    <m>\displaystyle\text{in}^{{2}}</m></p>
<p>What is the area of the large pizza? Round your answer to the nearest tenth. <fillin characters="4" />    <m>\displaystyle\text{in}^{{2}}</m></p>
<p>The area of the large pizza is <fillin characters="4" />    times as large as the medium pizza.</p>
<p>If the medium pizza costs <dollar/>12.99 , how much should the large pizza cost to have each square inch of pizza be of equal value? Round your answer to the nearest cent. <dollar/> <fillin characters="4" />   </p>
<p>Recall that the costs of the pizzas were <dollar/>12.99 and <dollar/>15.99. Which pizza is the better deal? (Assume more pizza per dollar = better.) </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>The large pizza.</li> 
<li>The medium pizza.</li> 
<li>They are the same price per square inch.</li> 
<li>This can't be determined.</li> 
</ol></p>
