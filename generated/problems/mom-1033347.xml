<p>Linda decides to order a pizza and wants to determine whether a medium, which costs <dollar/>12.49, or a large, which costs <dollar/>15.49 is the better deal.</p>

<p>The diameter of the large pizza is <input type="text" style="width:5.8ch" name="qn1000" id="qn1000" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1 Part 1 of 6" class="text"/>    times as large as the medium pizza.</p>
<p>What is the area of the medium pizza? Round your answer to the nearest tenth. <input type="text" style="width:5.8ch" name="qn1001" id="qn1001" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1 Part 2 of 6" class="text"/>    <m>\displaystyle\text{in}^{{2}}</m></p>
<p>What is the area of the large pizza? Round your answer to the nearest tenth. <input type="text" style="width:5.8ch" name="qn1002" id="qn1002" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1 Part 3 of 6" class="text"/>    <m>\displaystyle\text{in}^{{2}}</m></p>
<p>The area of the large pizza is <input type="text" style="width:5.8ch" name="qn1003" id="qn1003" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1 Part 4 of 6" class="text"/>    times as large as the medium pizza.</p>
<p>If the medium pizza costs <dollar/>12.49 , how much should the large pizza cost to have each square inch of pizza be of equal value? Round your answer to the nearest cent. <dollar/> <input type="text" style="width:5.8ch" name="qn1004" id="qn1004" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1 Part 5 of 6" class="text"/>   </p>
<p>Recall that the costs of the pizzas were <dollar/>12.49 and <dollar/>15.49. Which pizza is the better deal? (The better deal has a more pizza per dollar.) </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>The large pizza.</li> 
<li>The medium pizza.</li> 
<li>They are the same price per square inch.</li> 
<li>This can't be determined.</li>
