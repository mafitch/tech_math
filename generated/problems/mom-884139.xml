<statement>
<p>
A few winters ago, it was very cold in northern New Hampshire, and Roscoe thought about leaving the kitchen faucet running overnight (so the water pipes wouldn't freeze). Roscoe's roommate Breanna was a little concerned that they would be wasting a lot of water, so they performed an experiment.</p>
<p>
Breanna turned the kitchen faucet on so it was dripping water at a constant rate. Then she held up a 1/4 teaspoon
under the faucet, and it filled in <m>\displaystyle{11}</m> seconds. So, the water was "flowing" at a rate of <m>\displaystyle{0.25}</m> teaspoons per <m>\displaystyle{11}</m> seconds.</p>
<p>
<em>Question:</em> They were going to sleep and planned to get up <m>\displaystyle{8}</m> hours later to turn off the faucet. How many <em>gallons of water</em> would have gone down the drain in that time?</p>
<p>
<lbracket/>Answer this question by converting <m>\displaystyle{8}</m> hours into gallons. Give your answer as a decimal number, rounded correctly to the nearest thousandth of a gallon.<rbracket/></p>
<p>
Some Useful Unit Conversions</p>
<p><ul><li>0.25 teaspoons = 11 seconds</li><li>1 hour = 60 minutes</li><li>2 tablespoons = 1 fluid ounce</li><li>128 fluid ounces = 1 gallon</li><li>1 minute = 60 seconds</li><li>1 tablespoon = 3 teaspoons</li></ul></p>
<p>
In all, approximately <fillin characters="8" /> gallons of water will flow down the drain in <m>\displaystyle{8}</m> hours.
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>0.852</li></ul></p><p>We can begin with <m>\displaystyle{8}</m> hours as a fraction, and multiply by unit fractions, canceling units along the way until the remaining unit is just <em>gallons</em>:</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle\frac{{{8}\ {\color{red}\cancel{{\text{hours}}}}}}{{1}}\cdot\frac{{{60}\ {\color{blue}\cancel{{\text{minutes}}}}}}{{{1}\ {\color{red}\cancel{{\text{hour}}}}}}\cdot\frac{{{60}\ {\color{purp\le}\cancel{{\text{seconds}}}}}}{{{1}\ {\color{blue}\cancel{{\text{minute}}}}}}\cdot\frac{{{0.25}\ {\color{green}\cancel{{\text{tsp}}}}}}{{{11}\ {\color{purp\le}\cancel{{\text{sec}}}}}}\cdot\frac{{{1}\ {\color{\quad\textor\quadan\ge}\cancel{{\text{tbsp}}}}}}{{{3}\ {\color{green}\cancel{{\text{tsp}}}}}}\cdot\frac{{{1}\ \cancel{{\text{fl oz}}}}}{{{2}\ {\color{\quad\textor\quadan\ge}\cancel{{\text{tbsp}}}}}}\cdot\frac{{{1}\ \text{gallon}}}{{{128}\ \cancel{{\text{fl oz}}}}}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle=\frac{{{8}\cdot{60}\cdot{60}\cdot{0.25}}}{{{11}\cdot{3}\cdot{2}\cdot{128}}}\ \text{gallons}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle={0.85227272727273}\ \text{gallons}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle\approx{0.852}\ \text{gallons}</m></p>
