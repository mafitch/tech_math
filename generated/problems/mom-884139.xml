<statement>
<p>
A few winters ago, it was very cold in northern Maine, and Parvez thought about leaving the kitchen faucet running overnight (so the water pipes wouldn't freeze). Parvez's roommate Tallulah was a little concerned that they would be wasting a lot of water, so they performed an experiment.</p>
<p>
Tallulah turned the kitchen faucet on so it was dripping water at a constant rate. Then she held up a 1/4 teaspoon
under the faucet, and it filled in <m>\displaystyle{6}</m> seconds. So, the water was "flowing" at a rate of <m>\displaystyle{0.25}</m> teaspoons per <m>\displaystyle{6}</m> seconds.</p>
<p>
<em>Question:</em> They were going to sleep and planned to get up <m>\displaystyle{9}</m> hours later to turn off the faucet. How many <em>gallons of water</em> would have gone down the drain in that time?</p>
<p>
<lbracket/>Answer this question by converting <m>\displaystyle{9}</m> hours into gallons. Give your answer as a decimal number, rounded correctly to the nearest thousandth of a gallon.<rbracket/></p>
<p><ul><li>60 minutes = 1 hour</li><li>60 seconds = 1 minute</li><li>1 fluid ounce = 2 tablespoons</li><li>1 gallon = 128 fluid ounces</li><li>0.25 teaspoons = 6 seconds</li><li>3 teaspoons = 1 tablespoon</li></ul></p>
<p>
In all, approximately <fillin characters="8" /> gallons of water will flow down the drain in <m>\displaystyle{9}</m> hours.
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>1.758</li></ul></p><p>We can begin with <m>\displaystyle{9}</m> hours as a fraction, and multiply by unit fractions, canceling units along the way until the remaining unit is just <em>gallons</em>:</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle\frac{{{9}\ {\color{red}\cancel{{\text{hours}}}}}}{{1}}\cdot\frac{{{60}\ {\color{blue}\cancel{{\text{minutes}}}}}}{{{1}\ {\color{red}\cancel{{\text{hour}}}}}}\cdot\frac{{{60}\ {\color{purp\le}\cancel{{\text{seconds}}}}}}{{{1}\ {\color{blue}\cancel{{\text{minute}}}}}}\cdot\frac{{{0.25}\ {\color{green}\cancel{{\text{tsp}}}}}}{{{6}\ {\color{purp\le}\cancel{{\text{sec}}}}}}\cdot\frac{{{1}\ {\color{\quad\textor\quadan\ge}\cancel{{\text{tbsp}}}}}}{{{3}\ {\color{green}\cancel{{\text{tsp}}}}}}\cdot\frac{{{1}\ \cancel{{\text{fl oz}}}}}{{{2}\ {\color{\quad\textor\quadan\ge}\cancel{{\text{tbsp}}}}}}\cdot\frac{{{1}\ \text{gallon}}}{{{128}\ \cancel{{\text{fl oz}}}}}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle=\frac{{{9}\cdot{60}\cdot{60}\cdot{0.25}}}{{{6}\cdot{3}\cdot{2}\cdot{128}}}\ \text{gallons}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle={1.7578125}\ \text{gallons}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle\approx{1.758}\ \text{gallons}</m></p>
</solution>
