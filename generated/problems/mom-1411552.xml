<statement>
<p>Recall that light is a wave and so we can use the relationship that the speed of light is the wavelength of a photon multiplied by the frequency of a photon. <m>\displaystyle{c}=\lambda{f}</m>. A famous photon in astronomy is the photon emitted by a hydrogen atom with a frequency of <m>\displaystyle{f}={1440}</m> MHz. What is the wavelength of this photon in centimeters? <fillin characters="20" /> centimeters Preview Question 1 Â  </p>
