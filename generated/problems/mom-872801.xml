<statement>
<p>A student in a Pre-Calculus class has test scores of 68, 77, 67, and 71. The final exam is worth 4 test grades. </p>
<p>
Write a linear equation that models this problem, where <m>\displaystyle{x}</m> is the grade on the final exam and <m>\displaystyle{y}</m> is the student's grade in the course. The whole grade is based on these tests and the final.</p>
