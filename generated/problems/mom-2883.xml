<statement>
<p>
Newton's Law of Gravitation says that two objects with masses <m>\displaystyle{m}_{{1}}</m> and <m>\displaystyle{m}_{{2}}</m> attract each other with a force <m>\displaystyle{F}</m> that is jointly proportional to their masses and inversly proportional to the square of the distance <m>\displaystyle{r}</m> between the objects.  Newton discovered the constant of proportionality is <m>\displaystyle{6.67}\times{10}^{{-{11}}}</m>.</p>
<p>
In a small laboratory experiment, two 500 kg masses are separated by 0.9 meters.  What would the gravitational force between the objects be?</p>
<p>
Force = <fillin characters="20" /> Â   Newtons
