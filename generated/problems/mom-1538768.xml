<statement>
<p>An approximation of the speed at which a vehicle will hydroplane on water (complete loss of traction) is given below.</p>
<p>
  <m>\displaystyle{V}={10.2}\sqrt{{{p}}}</m></p>
<p>
  where</p>
<p>
  <m>\displaystyle{V}</m> is the velocity in miles per hour</p>
<p>
  <m>\displaystyle{p}</m> is the tire pressure in psi</p>
<p>You plan to travel no faster than 50 miles per hour. What pressure must your tire be over to be somewhat safe from hydroplaning? <fillin characters="4"/></p>
<p>These are science measurements. Round appropriately.</p>
