<statement>
<p>A manufacturer has just announced their new pogo stick. The accounting department has determined that the cost to manufacturer the pogo stick is <m>\displaystyle{c}={24.68}{n}+{34185}</m>, where <m>\displaystyle{n}</m> is the number of units manufactured and <m>\displaystyle{c}</m> is the resulting cost. The revenue equation is <m>\displaystyle{c}={89.18}{n}</m>.  What is the break even point? <input type="text" style="width:7ch" name="qn0" id="qn0" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1" class="text"/></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li><m>\displaystyle{\left({530},{47265.4}\right)}</m></li></ul></p><p>The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system. We can use substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{24.68}{n}+{34185}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{n}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{24.68}{n}+{34185}={89.18}{n}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{34185}={64.5}{n}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{n}={530}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for c</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{c}={89.18}\cdot{530}={47265.4}</m></p>
</solution>
