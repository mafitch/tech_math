<statement>
<p>A manufacturer has just announced their new pogo stick. The accounting department has determined that the cost to manufacturer the pogo stick is <m>\displaystyle{c}={25.49}{n}+{31416}</m>, where <m>\displaystyle{n}</m> is the number of units manufactured and <m>\displaystyle{c}</m> is the resulting cost. The revenue equation is <m>\displaystyle{c}={87.09}{n}</m>.  What is the break even point? <fillin characters="5"/></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li><m>\displaystyle{\left({510},{44415.9}\right)}</m></li></ul></p><p>The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system. We can use substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{25.49}{n}+{31416}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{n}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{25.49}{n}+{31416}={87.09}{n}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{31416}={61.6}{n}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{n}={510}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for c</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{c}={87.09}\cdot{510}={44415.9}</m></p>
</solution>
