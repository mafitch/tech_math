<statement>
<p>A manufacturer has just announced their new pogo stick. The accounting department has determined that the cost to manufacturer the pogo stick is <m>\displaystyle{c}={21.87}{n}+{30128}</m>, where <m>\displaystyle{n}</m> is the number of units manufactured and <m>\displaystyle{c}</m> is the resulting cost. The revenue equation is <m>\displaystyle{c}={75.67}{n}</m>.  What is the break even point? <fillin characters="5"/></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li><m>\displaystyle{\left({560},{42375.2}\right)}</m></li></ul></p><p>The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system. We can use substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{21.87}{n}+{30128}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{n}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{21.87}{n}+{30128}={75.67}{n}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{30128}={53.8}{n}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{n}={560}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for c</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{c}={75.67}\cdot{560}={42375.2}</m></p>
</solution>
