<statement>
<p>A manufacturer has just announced their new phone. The accounting department has determined that the cost to manufacturer the phone is <m>\displaystyle{c}={22.88}{n}+{36993}</m>, where <m>\displaystyle{n}</m> is the number of units manufactured and <m>\displaystyle{c}</m> is the resulting cost. The revenue equation is <m>\displaystyle{c}={85.58}{n}</m>.  What is the break even point? <input type="text" style="width:7ch" name="qn0" id="qn0" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1" class="text"/></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li><m>\displaystyle{\left({590},{50492.2}\right)}</m></li></ul></p><p>The equations are already written for us, so we just need to solve the system. We can use substitution.</p>
<p>
Substitute the expression <m>\displaystyle{22.88}{n}+{36993}</m> from the first equation into the second equation and solve for <m>\displaystyle{n}</m>.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{22.88}{n}+{36993}={85.58}{n}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{36993}={62.7}{n}</m></p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{n}={590}</m></p>
<p>
Now solve for c</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{c}={85.58}\cdot{590}={50492.2}</m></p>
</solution>
