<statement>
<p>
Suppose you start with a full tank of gas (17 gallons) in your truck.  After driving 6 hours, you now have 4 gallons left.</p>
<p>
If x is the number of hours you have been driving, then y is the number of gallons left in the tank.</p>
<p>
At what rate is the gas left in the tank changing? State your answer as a reduced fraction.</p>
<p>
<fillin characters="1" />  gallons per hour</p>
<p>
Find an equation of a line in the form y = mx + b that describes the amount of gas in your tank.</p>
