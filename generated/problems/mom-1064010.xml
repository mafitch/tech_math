<statement>
<p>Suppose you are standing such that a 40-foot tree is directly between you and the sun.  If you are 5 feet tall and the tree casts a 160-foot shadow, how far away from the tree can you stand and still be completely in the shadow of the tree?</p>
<image width="67%"  pi:generated="problems/images/95b554c99fc8f2d0e112c6d7553619fa.png" />
<p>The distance between you and the tree is <fillin characters="20" /> Â   ft (If needed, round to 1 decimal place.)</p>
