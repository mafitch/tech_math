<statement>
<p>Suppose you are standing such that a 20-foot tree is directly between you and the sun.  If you are 4 feet tall and the tree casts a 100-foot shadow, how far away from the tree can you stand and still be completely in the shadow of the tree?</p>
<image width="67%"  pi:generated="problems/images/92b7901fe47b62533d1b40d928692055.png" />
