<statement>
<p>Suppose enrollment in a class was 50 in the fall and 51 in the following spring.</p>
<p>It was a <fillin characters="20" /> percent </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>decrease</li>

<solution>
<p><ul><li>2</li><li>B: increase</li></ul></p><p>Because 51 is bigger than 50 it is a percent increase.</p>
<p>The percent increase is <m>\displaystyle{100}{\left(\frac{{{51}-{50}}}{{50}}\right)}={100}\cdot\frac{{1}}{{50}}\approx{2}\%</m>.</p>
