<statement>
<p>Suppose enrollment in a class was 72 in the fall and 75 in the following spring.</p>
<p>It was a <fillin characters="20" /> percent </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>decrease</li>

<solution>
<p><ul><li>4</li><li>B: increase</li></ul></p><p>Because 75 is bigger than 72 it is a percent increase.</p>
<p>The percent increase is <m>\displaystyle{100}{\left(\frac{{{75}-{72}}}{{72}}\right)}={100}\cdot\frac{{3}}{{72}}\approx{4}\%</m>.</p>
