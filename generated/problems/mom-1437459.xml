<statement>
<p>Suppose enrollment in a class was 80 in the fall and 70 in the following spring.</p>
<p>It was a <fillin characters="20"/> percent </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>decrease</li> 
<li>increase</li> 
</ol></p>



</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>13</li><li>A: decrease</li></ul></p><p>Because 80 is bigger than 70 it is a percent decrease.</p>
<p>The percent decrease is <m>\displaystyle{100}{\left(\frac{{{80}-{70}}}{{80}}\right)}={100}\cdot\frac{{10}}{{80}}\approx{13}\%</m>.</p>
