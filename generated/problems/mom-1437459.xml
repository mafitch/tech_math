<statement>
<p>Suppose enrollment in a class was 79 in the fall and 61 in the following spring.</p>
<p>It was a <fillin characters="20" /> percent </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>decrease</li>

<solution>
<p><ul><li>23</li><li>A: decrease</li></ul></p><p>Because 79 is bigger than 61 it is a percent decrease.</p>
<p>The percent decrease is <m>\displaystyle{100}{\left(\frac{{{79}-{61}}}{{79}}\right)}={100}\cdot\frac{{18}}{{79}}\approx{23}\%</m>.</p>
