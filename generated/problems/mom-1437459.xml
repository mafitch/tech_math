<statement>
<p>Suppose enrollment in a class was 76 in the fall and 62 in the following spring.</p>
<p>It was a <fillin characters="20" /> percent </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>decrease</li>

</ol></p>



</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>18</li><li>A: decrease</li></ul></p><p>Because 76 is bigger than 62 it is a percent decrease.</p>
<p>The percent decrease is <m>\displaystyle{100}{\left(\frac{{{76}-{62}}}{{76}}\right)}={100}\cdot\frac{{14}}{{76}}\approx{18}\%</m>.</p>
