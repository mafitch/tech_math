<statement>
<p>Suppose enrollment in a class was 57 in the fall and 69 in the following spring.</p>
<p>It was a <fillin characters="20" /> percent </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>decrease</li>

</ol></p>



</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>21</li><li>B: increase</li></ul></p><p>Because 69 is bigger than 57 it is a percent increase.</p>
<p>The percent increase is <m>\displaystyle{100}{\left(\frac{{{69}-{57}}}{{57}}\right)}={100}\cdot\frac{{12}}{{57}}\approx{21}\%</m>.</p>
