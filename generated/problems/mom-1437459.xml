<statement>
<p>Suppose enrollment in a class was 53 in the fall and 52 in the following spring.</p>
<p>It was a <fillin characters="20" /> percent </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>decrease</li>

<solution>
<p><ul><li>2</li><li>A: decrease</li></ul></p><p>Because 53 is bigger than 52 it is a percent decrease.</p>
<p>The percent decrease is <m>\displaystyle{100}{\left(\frac{{{53}-{52}}}{{53}}\right)}={100}\cdot\frac{{1}}{{53}}\approx{2}\%</m>.</p>
