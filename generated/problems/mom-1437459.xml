<statement>
<p>Suppose enrollment in a class was 79 in the fall and 63 in the following spring.</p>
<p>It was a <fillin characters="20" /> percent </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>decrease</li> 
<li>increase</li> 
</ol></p>



</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>20</li><li>A: decrease</li></ul></p><p>Because 79 is bigger than 63 it is a percent decrease.</p>
<p>The percent decrease is <m>\displaystyle{100}{\left(\frac{{{79}-{63}}}{{79}}\right)}={100}\cdot\frac{{16}}{{79}}\approx{20}\%</m>.</p>
