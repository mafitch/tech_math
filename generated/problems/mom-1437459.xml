<statement>
<p>Suppose enrollment in a class was 59 in the fall and 76 in the following spring.</p>
<p>It was a <fillin characters="20" /> percent </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>decrease</li>

</ol></p>



</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>29</li><li>B: increase</li></ul></p><p>Because 76 is bigger than 59 it is a percent increase.</p>
<p>The percent increase is <m>\displaystyle{100}{\left(\frac{{{76}-{59}}}{{59}}\right)}={100}\cdot\frac{{17}}{{59}}\approx{29}\%</m>.</p>
