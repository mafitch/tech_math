<statement>
<p>Suppose enrollment in a class was 59 in the fall and 51 in the following spring.</p>
<p>It was a <fillin characters="20" /> percent </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>decrease</li>

</ol></p>

<solution>
<p><ul><li>14</li><li>A: decrease</li></ul></p><p>Because 59 is bigger than 51 it is a percent decrease.</p>
<p>The percent decrease is <m>\displaystyle{100}{\left(\frac{{{59}-{51}}}{{59}}\right)}={100}\cdot\frac{{8}}{{59}}\approx{14}\%</m>.</p>
