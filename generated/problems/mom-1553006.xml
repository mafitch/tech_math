<statement>
<p>A subscription plan for a GPS tracking device costs <dollar/>14.95 per month plus <dollar/>0.10 per location ping (sent once every 10 minutes). What is the monthly charge if the device was used for 2 hours and 16 minutes? <fillin characters="6"/></p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li><dollar/>16.25</li></ul></p><p>First, we need to know how many pings are sent in 2 hours and 16 minutes. This is a total of <m>\displaystyle{2}\cdot{60}+{16}={136}</m> minutes. This is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{136}}{{10}}={13.6}</m> 10 minute periods. Any time past the last 10 minute segment does not generate another ping so only 13 pings will be sent.</p>
<p>Thus the cost is <m>\displaystyle\${14.95}+\${0.10}{\left({13}\right)}=\${16.25}</m>.</p>
</solution>
