<statement>
<p>A subscription plan for a GPS tracking device costs <dollar/>14.95 per month plus <dollar/>0.10 per location ping (sent once every 10 minutes). What is the monthly charge if the device was used for 3 hours and 38 minutes? <fillin characters="6"/></p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li><dollar/>17.05</li></ul></p><p>First, we need to know how many pings are sent in 3 hours and 38 minutes. This is a total of <m>\displaystyle{3}\cdot{60}+{38}={218}</m> minutes. This is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{218}}{{10}}={21.8}</m> 10 minute periods. Any time past the last 10 minute segment does not generate another ping so only 21 pings will be sent.</p>
<p>Thus the cost is <m>\displaystyle\${14.95}+\${0.10}{\left({21}\right)}=\${17.05}</m>.</p>
</solution>
