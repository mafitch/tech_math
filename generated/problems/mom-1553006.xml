<statement>
<p>A subscription plan for a GPS tracking device costs <dollar/>11.95 per month plus <dollar/>0.10 per location ping (sent once every 10 minutes). What is the monthly charge if the device was used for 3 hours and 42 minutes? <fillin characters="6" /></p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li><dollar/>14.15</li></ul></p><p>First, we need to know how many pings are sent in 3 hours and 42 minutes. This is a total of <m>\displaystyle{3}\cdot{60}+{42}={222}</m> minutes. This is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{222}}{{10}}={22.2}</m> 10 minute periods. Any time past the last 10 minute segment does not generate another ping so only 22 pings will be sent.</p>
<p>Thus the cost is <m>\displaystyle\${11.95}+\${0.10}{\left({22}\right)}=\${14.15}</m>.</p>
</solution>
