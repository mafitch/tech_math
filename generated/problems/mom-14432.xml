<p>
The path of a satellite orbiting the earth causes it to pass directly over two tracking stations <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, which are 69 km apart.  When the satellite is on one side of the two stations, the angles of elevation at <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are measured to be 86.9° and 83.9°, respectively.
