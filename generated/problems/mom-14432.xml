<statement>
<p>
The path of a satellite orbiting the earth causes it to pass directly over two tracking stations <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, which are 60 mi apart.  When the satellite is on one side of the two stations, the angles of elevation at <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are measured to be 87.8° and 83.7°, respectively.
