<solution>
<p><ul><li>640</li></ul></p><p>The two products multiply a number with 3 significant digits by a number with 2 significant digits. The result should have only 2 significant digits. For these products that will be the 100's and 10's positions.</p>
<p>The sum then is adding two numbers with the last significant digit in the 10's position, so the final result has its last significant digit in the 10's position.</p>
