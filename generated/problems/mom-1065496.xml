A <em>kite</em> is a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacents sides of equal length (think of simple ones you can fly).</p>
<p>
A kite has two sides of length <m>\displaystyle{a}={b}={4.2}</m> and two sides of length <m>\displaystyle{c}={d}={3.7}</m> (all measured in yards).  The angle between the largest sides is <m>\displaystyle\alpha={42}^\circ</m>.</p><image width="42%"  pi:generated="problems/images/a12554347212f32b5f565c64c1cf7e08.png" /><p>
What is the area of this kite? <fillin characters="20" /> ydÂ²</p>
<p>
