<statement>
<p>An aircraft in flight has total energy given by <m>\displaystyle\frac{{1}}{{2}}{m}{v}^{{2}}+{m}{g}{h}</m> where</p>
<p>
  <m>\displaystyle{m}</m> is the mass of the aircraft in pounds</p>
<p>
  <m>\displaystyle{v}</m> is the velocity in feet/second</p>
<p>
  <m>\displaystyle{g}={32.1740}</m> is earth's standard gravity</p>
<p>
  <m>\displaystyle{h}</m> is the height above sea level in feet</p>
<p>Suppose a glider with mass 1170 lbs and initial velocity 92 ft/s is at an altitude of 8,000. ft MSL. If the pilot wants to increase the velocity to 147 ft/s to what altitude must it descend? <fillin characters="5" /> ft MSL</p>
<p>The initial altitude has four significant digits. Hint: The total energy will be the same before and after the altitude change.</p>
