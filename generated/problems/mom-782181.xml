<statement>
<p>Out of the last 42 days, it rained 8 days. What percent of these days did it rain? <fillin characters="20" /> <percent/></p>
<p><em> Round to 2 decimal places.</em></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>19.05</li></ul></p><p>We recall that a percent is part/whole scaled by 100. Here we have <m>\displaystyle\frac{{8}}{{42}}={0.19047619047619}</m>. We convert this to a percent by <m>\displaystyle{100}\cdot{0.19047619047619}={19.047619047619}</m> <percent/>. Lastly we round to two decimal places. The rounded percent is 19.05 <percent/>.</p>
