<statement>
<p>What is the percent increase if enrollment in a class was 51 in spring and 83 in the following fall? <fillin characters="5" /></p>
<p>Round to the nearest percent (ones).</p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>63</li></ul></p><p>Because 83 is bigger than 51, we know this is a percent increase.</p>
<p>The increase is <m>\displaystyle{83}-{51}={32}</m>. Thus the percent increase is</p>
<p><m>\displaystyle{100}\cdot\frac{{32}}{{51}}={63}</m></p>
</solution>
