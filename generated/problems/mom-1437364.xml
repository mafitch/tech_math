<statement>
<p>What is the percent increase if enrollment in a class was 60 in spring and 87 in the following fall? <fillin characters="5" /></p>
<p>Round to the nearest percent (ones).</p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>45</li></ul></p><p>Because 87 is bigger than 60, we know this is a percent increase.</p>
<p>The increase is <m>\displaystyle{87}-{60}={27}</m>. Thus the percent increase is</p>
<p><m>\displaystyle{100}\cdot\frac{{27}}{{60}}={45}</m></p>
