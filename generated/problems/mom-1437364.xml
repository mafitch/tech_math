<statement>
<p>What is the percent increase if enrollment in a class was 53 in spring and 80 in the following fall? <fillin characters="5" /></p>
<p>Round to the nearest percent (ones).</p>

<solution>
<p><ul><li>51</li></ul></p><p>Because 80 is bigger than 53, we know this is a percent increase.</p>
<p>The increase is <m>\displaystyle{80}-{53}={27}</m>. Thus the percent increase is</p>
<p><m>\displaystyle{100}\cdot\frac{{27}}{{53}}={51}</m></p>
</solution>
