<statement>
<p>What is the percent increase if enrollment in a class was 58 in spring and 84 in the following fall? <fillin characters="5" /></p>
<p>Round to the nearest percent (ones).</p>

<solution>
<p><ul><li>45</li></ul></p><p>Because 84 is bigger than 58, we know this is a percent increase.</p>
<p>The increase is <m>\displaystyle{84}-{58}={26}</m>. Thus the percent increase is</p>
<p><m>\displaystyle{100}\cdot\frac{{26}}{{58}}={45}</m></p>
