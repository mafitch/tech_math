<statement>
<p>What is the percent increase if enrollment in a class was 50 in spring and 82 in the following fall? <fillin characters="5" /></p>
<p>Round to the nearest percent (ones).</p>

<p><ul><li>64</li></ul></p><p>Because 82 is bigger than 50, we know this is a percent increase.</p>
<p>The increase is <m>\displaystyle{82}-{50}={32}</m>. Thus the percent increase is</p>
<p><m>\displaystyle{100}\cdot\frac{{32}}{{50}}={64}</m></p>
