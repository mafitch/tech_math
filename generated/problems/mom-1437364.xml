<statement>
<p>What is the percent increase if enrollment in a class was 51 in spring and 87 in the following fall? <input type="text" style="width:7ch" name="qn0" id="qn0" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1" class="text"/></p>
<p>Round to the nearest percent (ones).</p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>71</li></ul></p><p>Because 87 is bigger than 51, we know this is a percent increase.</p>
<p>The increase is <m>\displaystyle{87}-{51}={36}</m>. Thus the percent increase is</p>
<p><m>\displaystyle{100}\cdot\frac{{36}}{{51}}={71}</m></p>
