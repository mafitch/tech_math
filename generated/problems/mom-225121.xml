<statement>
<p>In April 1986, a flawed reactor design played a part in the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown. Approximately 14252 becqurels (Bqs), units of radioactivity, were initially released into the environment. Only areas with less than 800 Bqs are considered safe for human habitation. The function <m>\displaystyle{f{{\left({x}\right)}}}={14252}{\left({0.5}\right)}^{{\frac{{x}}{{32}}}}</m> describes the amount, <m>\displaystyle{f{{\left({x}\right)}}}</m> , in becqurels, of a radioactive element remaining in the area <m>\displaystyle{x}</m> years after 1986.</p>
<p>Find <m>\displaystyle{f{{\left({150}\right)}}}</m> , to one decimal place, in order to determine the amount of becqurels in 2136.</p>

<p>Determine if the area is safe for human habitation in the year 2136.</p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>Yes, because by 2136, the radioactive element remaining in the area is greater than 800 Bqs.</li> 
<li>Yes, because by 2136, the radioactive element remaining in the area is less than 800 Bqs.</li> 
<li>No, because by 2136, the radioactive element remaining in the area is greater than 800 Bqs.</li> 
<li>No, because by 2136, the radioactive element remaining in the area is less than 800 Bqs.</li>
