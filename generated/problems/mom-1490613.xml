<p>What is the frequency of this wave? <fillin characters="4" />   </p>
<p>What is the period of this wave? <fillin characters="4" />   </p>
<p>What is the amplitude of this wave? <fillin characters="4" />   </p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>2</li><li>0.5</li><li>3</li></ul></p><p>The frequency is 2, because there are 2 copies of the curve from 0 to 1.</p>
<p>The period is 0.5, because one copy of the curve is completed by 0.5. Also period is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{1}}{{2}}={0.5}</m>.</p>
<p>The amplitude is 3, because the curve oscillates between -3 and 3.</p>
</solution>
