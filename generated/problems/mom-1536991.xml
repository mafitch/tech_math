<statement>
<p>The rod end of a cylinder has less surface area than the cap end, because the rod covers part of the cap on that side. As a result more pressure is needed on the rod end to create the necessary force for motion. The amount of force needed is proportional to the ratio of cap to rod area.</p>
<image width="100%"  pi:generated="problems/images/hydraulic_piston_compare.png" />
<p>If the ratio of cap to rod area is 25/9 and the pressure on the cap side is 12000, what pressure will be needed on the rod side? <fillin characters="20" /></p>
