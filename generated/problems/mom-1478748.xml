<statement>
<p>An aircraft in flight has total energy given by <m>\displaystyle\frac{{1}}{{2}}{m}{v}^{{2}}+{m}{g}{h}</m> where</p>
<p>
  <m>\displaystyle{m}</m> is the mass of the aircraft in pounds</p>
<p>
  <m>\displaystyle{v}</m> is the velocity in feet/second</p>
<p>
  <m>\displaystyle{g}={32.1740}</m> is earth's standard gravity</p>
<p>
  <m>\displaystyle{h}</m> is the height above sea level in feet</p>
<p>Suppose a glider with mass 1072 lbs and initial velocity 99 ft/s is at an altitude of 3,700. ft MSL. If the glider forces a descent to 3,526 ft MSL, what must the new velocity be? <fillin characters="5" /> ft/s</p>
<p>Altitudes have four significant digits. Hint: The total energy will be the same before and after the altitude change.</p>
