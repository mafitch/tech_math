<statement>
<p>In the model <m>\displaystyle{A}={185.6}{e}^{{{0.0328}{t}}}</m> what is the percent increase or decrease? <fillin characters="6" /></p>
<p>Note all numbers are scientific measurements.</p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>3.33</li></ul></p><p>The percent increase/decrease is calculated from <m>\displaystyle{e}^{{0.0328}}\approx{1.0333438498031}</m>. Because this is bigger than 1, this is a percent increase and the result is <m>\displaystyle{1.0333438498031}-{1}={0.03334384980309}\approx{0.0333}</m> and the percent is 3.33<percent/>.</p>
<p>We round to 3 significant digits because the measurement (exponent) had 3 significant digits.</p>
</solution>
