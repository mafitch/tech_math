<statement>
<p>In the model <m>\displaystyle{A}={169.5}{e}^{{{0.0288}{t}}}</m> what is the percent increase or decrease? <input type="text" style="width:8.2ch" name="qn0" id="qn0" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1" class="text"/></p>
<p>Note all numbers are scientific measurements; round accordingly.</p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>2.92</li></ul></p><p>The percent increase/decrease is calculated from <m>\displaystyle{e}^{{0.0288}}\approx{1.0292187301434}</m>. Because this is bigger than 1, this is a percent increase and the result is <m>\displaystyle{1.0292187301434}-{1}={0.029218730143355}\approx{0.0292}</m> and the percent is 2.92<percent/>.</p>
<p>We round to 3 significant digits because the measurement (exponent) had 3 significant digits.</p>
