<statement>
<p>In the model <m>\displaystyle{A}={170.8}{e}^{{{0.0211}{t}}}</m> what is the percent increase or decrease? <fillin characters="6" /></p>
<p>Note all numbers are scientific measurements.</p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>2.13</li></ul></p><p>The percent increase/decrease is calculated from <m>\displaystyle{e}^{{0.0211}}\approx{1.021324178949}</m>. Because this is bigger than 1, this is a percent increase and the result is <m>\displaystyle{1.021324178949}-{1}={0.021324178948973}\approx{0.0213}</m> and the percent is 2.13<percent/>.</p>
<p>We round to 3 significant digits because the measurement (exponent) had 3 significant digits.</p>
</solution>
