<statement>
<p>In the model <m>\displaystyle{A}={197.2}{e}^{{{0.0293}{t}}}</m> what is the percent increase or decrease? <fillin characters="6"/></p>
<p>Note all numbers are scientific measurements.</p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>2.97</li></ul></p><p>The percent increase/decrease is calculated from <m>\displaystyle{e}^{{0.0293}}\approx{1.0297334681822}</m>. Because this is bigger than 1, this is a percent increase and the result is <m>\displaystyle{1.0297334681822}-{1}={0.029733468182213}\approx{0.0297}</m> and the percent is 2.97<percent/>.</p>
<p>We round to 3 significant digits because the measurement (exponent) had 3 significant digits.</p>
</solution>
