<statement>
<p>In the model <m>\displaystyle{A}={150.7}{e}^{{{0.0484}{t}}}</m> what is the percent increase or decrease? <fillin characters="6" /></p>
<p>Note all numbers are scientific measurements.</p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>4.96</li></ul></p><p>The percent increase/decrease is calculated from <m>\displaystyle{e}^{{0.0484}}\approx{1.0495904075314}</m>. Because this is bigger than 1, this is a percent increase and the result is <m>\displaystyle{1.0495904075314}-{1}={0.049590407531445}\approx{0.0496}</m> and the percent is 4.96<percent/>.</p>
<p>We round to 3 significant digits because the measurement (exponent) had 3 significant digits.</p>
</solution>
