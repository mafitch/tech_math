<statement>
<p>The optimal angle for an extension ladder is <m>\displaystyle{75}^{\circ}</m>. This is approximated by placing the feet of the ladder 1/4 the length of the ladder from where the rails rest at the top.</p>
<p>Suppose the ladder is 350 inches long. How far from the edge should the feet of the ladder be placed? <fillin characters="5" /></p>
<p>What angle does this actually make? <fillin characters="5" /></p>
