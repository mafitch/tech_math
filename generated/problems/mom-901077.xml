  <url href="#">Image Description</url>A closed shape with five straight sides, with its interior shaded, where four of its five sides are either horizontal or vertical. Beginning at the bottom right corner and moving straight up, the path around the shape starts with a side that is  labeled 104 yards, then moving to the left, a side is  labeled 44 yards, then moving diagonally down and left, a side is  labeled 37 yards, then moving straight down, a side is  labeled 92 yards, and finally moving to the right, a side is  unlabeled, connecting back to the original starting point at bottom right.</p>
