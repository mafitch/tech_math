  <url href="#">Image Description</url>A closed shape with five straight sides, with its interior shaded, where four of its five sides are either horizontal or vertical. Beginning at the bottom left corner and moving to the right, the path around the shape starts with a side that is  labeled 43 yards, then moving straight up, a side is  labeled 35 yards, then moving diagonally up and left, a side is  unlabeled, then moving to the left, a side is  labeled 33 yards, and finally moving straight down, a side is  labeled 59 yards, connecting back to the original starting point at bottom left.</p>
