<statement>
<p>Suppose that as dry air rose its temperature dropped in a linear fashion. The temperature was measured at 1300 ft MSL as <m>\displaystyle{25}^{\circ}</m> C and at 3300 ft MSL as <m>\displaystyle{29.2}^{\circ}</m> C.</p>
<p>What is the rate of change of temperature with respect to altitude? <fillin characters="20" /> Â  </p>
<p>Your response may be as a fraction such as 2/1000 or decimal such as 0.002</p>
<p>What does this data imply about the temperature at 0 ft MSL? <fillin characters="20" /></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>-0.0021</li><li>22.27</li></ul></p><p>We want the ratio of temperature drop to altitude increase. <m>\displaystyle\frac{{{29.2}-{25}}}{{{3300}-{1300}}}=-{0.0021}</m></p>
<p>Now that we know that ratio we can use a linear model to find the temperature at sea level. Because the temperature increases (we are going down not up) at a rate of -2.1 per 1000 ft the temperature will be expected to increase <m>\displaystyle{1300}{\left(-\frac{{2.1}}{{1000}}\right)}=-{2.73}</m>. That will result in a temperature of <m>\displaystyle{25}\pm{2.73}={22.27}</m>.</p>
</solution>
