<statement>
<p>Suppose that as dry air rose its temperature dropped in a linear fashion. The temperature was measured at 1200 ft MSL as <m>\displaystyle{12}^{\circ}</m> C and at 2200 ft MSL as <m>\displaystyle{14.2}^{\circ}</m> C.</p>
<p>What is the rate of change of temperature with respect to altitude? <input type="text" style="width:25ch" name="qn1000" id="qn1000" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1 Part 1 of 2" class="text"/> Â  </p>
<p>Your response may be as a fraction such as 2/1000 or decimal such as 0.002</p>
<p>What does this data imply about the temperature at 0 ft MSL? <input type="text" style="width:25ch" name="qn1001" id="qn1001" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1 Part 2 of 2" class="text"/></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>-0.0022</li><li>9.36</li></ul></p><p>We want the ratio of temperature drop to altitude increase. <m>\displaystyle\frac{{{14.2}-{12}}}{{{2200}-{1200}}}=-{0.0022}</m></p>
<p>Now that we know that ratio we can use a linear model to find the temperature at sea level. Because the temperature increases (we are going down not up) at a rate of -2.2 per 1000 ft the temperature will be expected to increase <m>\displaystyle{1200}{\left(-\frac{{2.2}}{{1000}}\right)}=-{2.64}</m>. That will result in a temperature of <m>\displaystyle{12}\pm{2.64}={9.36}</m>.</p>
</solution>
