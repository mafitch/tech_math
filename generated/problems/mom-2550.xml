Becky takes out a 25-year mortagage for which her monthly payment is <dollar/>1300.  During the early years of the mortgage, most of each payment is for interest and the rather small remainder for principal.  As time goes on, the portion of each payment that goes for interest decreases while the portion for principal increases, as shown in the following graph:</p><image width="67%"  pi:generated="problems/images/211fe9deaf1f6f0673c78eecb994b052.png" />
