<statement>
<p>Constanza is making candles in the shape of a cylinder. She needs to determine how many cubic centimeters of wax she needs. (Use the <m>\displaystyle\pi</m>  button in your computation. Round to significant figures, as appropriate.)
  </p><image width="18%"  pi:generated="problems/images/candle.jpg" />
  <p>
  If the radius of the candle is 2.0 cm and the height of the candle is 13.0 cm
  </p>
<p>
  (a) How much wax is needed for one candle?</p>
<p><fillin characters="20" /> <m>\displaystyle{c}{m}^{{3}}</m>
  </p>
<p>
  (b) How much wax is needed for 20 candles?</p>
<p><fillin characters="20" /> <m>\displaystyle{c}{m}^{{3}}</m>
  </p>
<p>
  (c) If wax is sold in cubic meters, how many completecandles can be made with 1 cubic meter of wax? </p>
<p>Hint: 1 cubic m = 1,000,000 cubic cm</p>
