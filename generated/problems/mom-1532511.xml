<statement>
<p>Vasya's initial salary is <dollar/>58500. If she receives a raise of <dollar/>4600 each year, what is the first year her salary is greater (or equal to) <dollar/>100,000? <fillin characters="20" /></p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>10</li></ul></p><p>Her salary must increase more than <dollar/>100,000-<dollar/>58500 = <dollar/>41500. This will take <m>\displaystyle\frac{{41500}}{{4600}}={9.0217391304348}</m> years. Because she won't be more than <dollar/>100,000 until the final, full year that is 10 years.</p>
