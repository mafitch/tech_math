<statement>
<p>Vasya's initial salary is <dollar/>61000. If she receives a raise of <dollar/>4700 each year, what is the first year her salary is greater (or equal to) <dollar/>100,000? <input type="text" style="width:25ch" name="qn0" id="qn0" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1" class="text"/></p>

<solution>
<p><ul><li>9</li></ul></p><p>Her salary must increase more than <dollar/>100,000-<dollar/>61000 = <dollar/>39000. This will take <m>\displaystyle\frac{{39000}}{{4700}}={8.2978723404255}</m> years. Because she won't be more than <dollar/>100,000 until the final, full year that is 9 years.</p>
