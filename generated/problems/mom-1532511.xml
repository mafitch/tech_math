<statement>
<p>Vasya's initial salary is <dollar/>68800. If she receives a raise of <dollar/>2900 each year, what is the first year her salary is greater (or equal to) <dollar/>100,000? <fillin characters="20" /></p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>11</li></ul></p><p>Her salary must increase more than <dollar/>100,000-<dollar/>68800 = <dollar/>31200. This will take <m>\displaystyle\frac{{31200}}{{2900}}={10.758620689655}</m> years. Because she won't be more than <dollar/>100,000 until the final, full year that is 11 years.</p>
