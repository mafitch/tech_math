<statement>
<p>Vasya's initial salary is <dollar/>53000. If she receives a raise of <dollar/>3300 each year, what is the first year her salary is greater (or equal to) <dollar/>100,000? <fillin characters="20"/></p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>15</li></ul></p><p>Her salary must increase more than <dollar/>100,000-<dollar/>53000 = <dollar/>47000. This will take <m>\displaystyle\frac{{47000}}{{3300}}={14.242424242424}</m> years. Because she won't be more than <dollar/>100,000 until the final, full year that is 15 years.</p>
