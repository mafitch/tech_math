<statement>
<p>Vasya's initial salary is <dollar/>68600. If she receives a raise of <dollar/>5900 each year, what is the first year her salary is greater (or equal to) <dollar/>100,000? <input type="text" style="width:25ch" name="qn0" id="qn0" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1" class="text"/></p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>6</li></ul></p><p>Her salary must increase more than <dollar/>100,000-<dollar/>68600 = <dollar/>31400. This will take <m>\displaystyle\frac{{31400}}{{5900}}={5.3220338983051}</m> years. Because she won't be more than <dollar/>100,000 until the final, full year that is 6 years.</p>
