<statement>
<p>Vasya's initial salary is <dollar/>58300. If she receives a raise of <dollar/>4900 each year, what is the first year her salary is greater (or equal to) <dollar/>100,000? <fillin characters="20"/></p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>9</li></ul></p><p>Her salary must increase more than <dollar/>100,000-<dollar/>58300 = <dollar/>41700. This will take <m>\displaystyle\frac{{41700}}{{4900}}={8.5102040816327}</m> years. Because she won't be more than <dollar/>100,000 until the final, full year that is 9 years.</p>
