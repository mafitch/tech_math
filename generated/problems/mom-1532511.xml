<statement>
<p>Vasya's initial salary is <dollar/>51600. If she receives a raise of <dollar/>3500 each year, what is the first year her salary is greater (or equal to) <dollar/>100,000? <fillin characters="20" /></p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>14</li></ul></p><p>Her salary must increase more than <dollar/>100,000-<dollar/>51600 = <dollar/>48400. This will take <m>\displaystyle\frac{{48400}}{{3500}}={13.828571428571}</m> years. Because she won't be more than <dollar/>100,000 until the final, full year that is 14 years.</p>
