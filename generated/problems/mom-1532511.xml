<statement>
<p>Vasya's initial salary is <dollar/>52500. If she receives a raise of <dollar/>2500 each year, what is the first year her salary is greater (or equal to) <dollar/>100,000? <fillin characters="20" /></p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>19</li></ul></p><p>Her salary must increase more than <dollar/>100,000-<dollar/>52500 = <dollar/>47500. This will take <m>\displaystyle\frac{{47500}}{{2500}}={19}</m> years. Because she won't be more than <dollar/>100,000 until the final, full year that is 19 years.</p>
