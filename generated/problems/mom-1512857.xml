<statement>
<p>The length of the near field of an ultrasonic tester is given by <m>\displaystyle{L}=\frac{{D}^{{2}}}{{{4}\lambda}}</m> where <m>\displaystyle{D}</m> is the diameter of the transducer (depends on crystal size) and <m>\displaystyle\lambda</m> is the wavelength.</p>
<p>If we want the near field length  to be <m>\displaystyle{L}={0.00000002644}</m> meters and we want to use the frequency with wavelength <m>\displaystyle\lambda={614.28571428571}</m> cycles per meter in brass, what diameter in centimeters do we need? <fillin characters="20" /></p>
