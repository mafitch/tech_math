<statement>
<p>The ideal gas law can be expressed as <m>\displaystyle{P}{V}={n}{R}{T}</m> where <m>\displaystyle{P}</m> is pressure in atm (atmospheres), <m>\displaystyle{V}</m> is volume in liters, <m>\displaystyle{n}</m> is the number of moles (a count of molecules), <m>\displaystyle{R}</m> is a constant from physics, and <m>\displaystyle{T}</m> is the temperature (from absolute zero).</p>
<p>What is the pressure, in atmospheres, of 11.3 moles of a gas at a temperature of 304.9 K in a 418 liter container when R = 0.0821 (atm<asterisk/>L)/(mol<asterisk/>K)? </p>
