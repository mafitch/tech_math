<p>The image above illustrates a fuel tank tipped up. The port out of which fuel is pumped is closer to the left side of the tank than the right side. Due to the uphill angle there is an area (below the blue line) on the bottom, left that is below the port. Because it is below, that fuel cannot be used. The same problem would exist if the vehicle were headed downhill, but the volume of fuel would be different. Supposing the angle is the same (just down instead of up), there would be more unusable fuel when the vehicle is heading </p>
