<p>A building blocks the views of two drivers. The car driving to the right (at the top left in the diagram) has just reached the location where its driver first sees the car waiting at the intersection to pull out (at the bottom right in the diagram). Suppose the car waiting is 30.0 ft to the right of the building and 2.7 ft from the intersection. Suppose as well that the driver of the moving car is 4.6 ft from the right side of the car, and the right side of the car is 1.0 ft from the building. How far is the driving car from the edge of the building (labeled s)? <fillin characters="5"/></p>
<p>
  Round to the nearest foot. </p>
<p>If the car is traveling to the right at 45 mph, how much time, in seconds, is there between first seeing the other car, and entering the intersection? <fillin characters="5"/></p>
<p>
  Round to the nearest second. </p>
