<statement>
<p>Torque is used to measure how tight a bolt is. The unit is foot-pounds (ft-lbs). For example 5 ft-lbs is the tightness obtained by putting 5 lbs (weight) at the end of a one foot long wrench.</p>
<p>Guido decides to experiment with torque by hanging from a wrench. If Guido weighs 130 lbs and hangs on the wrench 20 inches from the center of the bolt, what torque is generated? <input type="text" style="width:7ch" name="qn1000" id="qn1000" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1 Part 1 of 4" class="text"/></p>
<p>Because this is an experiment, round according to the rules for measurement.</p>
<p>Guido realizes that his hand is 5.2 inches wide, and he might not be putting his weight in the exact center of his hand on the wrench. If the center of his hand is 20 inches from the center of the bolt, what is the expected torque if his weight is all on the side of his hand closest to the bolt? <input type="text" style="width:7ch" name="qn1001" id="qn1001" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1 Part 2 of 4" class="text"/></p>
<p>
  What if his weight is all on the side of his hand farthest from the bolt? <input type="text" style="width:7ch" name="qn1002" id="qn1002" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1 Part 3 of 4" class="text"/></p>
<p>If the torque produced from the center of his hand is the correct one, what is the greatest possible error? (Use your calculations above) <input type="text" style="width:7ch" name="qn1003" id="qn1003" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1 Part 4 of 4" class="text"/></p>
