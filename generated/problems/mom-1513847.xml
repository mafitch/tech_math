<p>One measure of ductility, the ability of metal to be pulled into wires, is area reduction. This is measured as the percent decrease of area after pulling a sample piece of metal. The image above illustrates the metal sample before (on top) and after the pull (on bottom). A is the area of the round sample before the pull. B is the area after the pull (in this case pulled apart). The formula is <m>\displaystyle{R}=\frac{{{A}-{B}}}{{A}}\times{100}</m>.</p>
<p>Guido uses callipers to measure the diameters and calculates the areas <m>\displaystyle{A}=\pi\frac{{\left({d}_{{A}}\right)}^{{2}}}{{4}}</m> and <m>\displaystyle{B}=\pi\frac{{\left({d}_{{B}}\right)}^{{2}}}{{4}}</m>, where <m>\displaystyle{d}_{{A}}</m> and <m>\displaystyle{d}_{{B}}</m> are the diameters. He uses these to calculate the area reduction. Wolfgang calculates the area reduction using the same formula but solely the diameters (effectively <m>\displaystyle{A}={d}_{{A}}</m> and <m>\displaystyle{B}={d}_{{B}}</m>).</p>
<p>Do they end up with the same result for ductility? </p>
