<statement>
<p>In 37.04 <percent/> of the last 27 days it rained. How many days did it not rain? <fillin characters="20" /> days</p>
<p><em>Round to the nearest whole.</em></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>17</li></ul></p><p>We recall that a percent as a decimal is part/whole. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{P}}{{27}}={0.3704}</m>. We solve for P by multiplying by <m>\displaystyle{27}</m>. <m>\displaystyle{P}={0.3704}\cdot{27}={10.0008}</m>. This is the number of days that it rained. We want the non-rainy days which is 27-10.0008=16.9992 We round that as requested to 17.</p>
