<statement>
<p>In 41.94 <percent/> of the last 31 days it rained. How many days did it not rain? <fillin characters="20" /> days</p>
<p><em>Round to the nearest whole.</em></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>18</li></ul></p><p>We recall that a percent as a decimal is part/whole. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{P}}{{31}}={0.4194}</m>. We solve for P by multiplying by <m>\displaystyle{31}</m>. <m>\displaystyle{P}={0.4194}\cdot{31}={13.0014}</m>. This is the number of days that it rained. We want the non-rainy days which is 31-13.0014=17.9986 We round that as requested to 18.</p>
