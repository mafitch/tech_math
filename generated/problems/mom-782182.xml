<statement>
<p>In 43.24 <percent/> of the last 37 days it rained. How many days did it not rain? <fillin characters="20" /> days</p>
<p><em>Round to the nearest whole.</em></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>21</li></ul></p><p>We recall that a percent as a decimal is part/whole. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{P}}{{37}}={0.4324}</m>. We solve for P by multiplying by <m>\displaystyle{37}</m>. <m>\displaystyle{P}={0.4324}\cdot{37}={15.9988}</m>. This is the number of days that it rained. We want the non-rainy days which is 37-15.9988=21.0012 We round that as requested to 21.</p>
