<statement>
<p>In 23.26 <percent/> of the last 43 days it rained. How many days did it not rain? <fillin characters="20" /> days</p>
<p><em>Round to the nearest whole.</em></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>33</li></ul></p><p>We recall that a percent as a decimal is part/whole. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{P}}{{43}}={0.2326}</m>. We solve for P by multiplying by <m>\displaystyle{43}</m>. <m>\displaystyle{P}={0.2326}\cdot{43}={10.0018}</m>. This is the number of days that it rained. We want the non-rainy days which is 43-10.0018=32.9982 We round that as requested to 33.</p>
