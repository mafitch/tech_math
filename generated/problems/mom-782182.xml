<statement>
<p>In 51.43 <percent/> of the last 35 days it rained. How many days did it not rain? <fillin characters="20" /> days</p>
<p><em>Round to the nearest whole.</em></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>17</li></ul></p><p>We recall that a percent as a decimal is part/whole. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{P}}{{35}}={0.5143}</m>. We solve for P by multiplying by <m>\displaystyle{35}</m>. <m>\displaystyle{P}={0.5143}\cdot{35}={18.0005}</m>. This is the number of days that it rained. We want the non-rainy days which is 35-18.0005=16.9995 We round that as requested to 17.</p>
