<statement>
<p>In 36.36 <percent/> of the last 44 days it rained. How many days did it not rain? <input type="text" style="width:25ch" name="qn0" id="qn0" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1" class="text"/> days</p>
<p><em>Round to the nearest whole.</em></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>28</li></ul></p><p>We recall that a percent as a decimal is part/whole. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{P}}{{44}}={0.3636}</m>. We solve for P by multiplying by <m>\displaystyle{44}</m>. <m>\displaystyle{P}={0.3636}\cdot{44}={15.9984}</m>. This is the number of days that it rained. We want the non-rainy days which is 44-15.9984=28.0016 We round that as requested to 28.</p>
