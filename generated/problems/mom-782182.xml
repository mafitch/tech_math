<statement>
<p>In 53.13 <percent/> of the last 32 days it rained. How many days did it not rain? <fillin characters="20" /> days</p>
<p><em>Round to the nearest whole.</em></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>15</li></ul></p><p>We recall that a percent as a decimal is part/whole. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{P}}{{32}}={0.5313}</m>. We solve for P by multiplying by <m>\displaystyle{32}</m>. <m>\displaystyle{P}={0.5313}\cdot{32}={17.0016}</m>. This is the number of days that it rained. We want the non-rainy days which is 32-17.0016=14.9984 We round that as requested to 15.</p>
