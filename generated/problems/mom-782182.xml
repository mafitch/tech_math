<statement>
<p>In 17.02 <percent/> of the last 47 days it rained. How many days did it not rain? <fillin characters="20" /> days</p>
<p><em>Round to the nearest whole.</em></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>39</li></ul></p><p>We recall that a percent as a decimal is part/whole. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{P}}{{47}}={0.1702}</m>. We solve for P by multiplying by <m>\displaystyle{47}</m>. <m>\displaystyle{P}={0.1702}\cdot{47}={7.9994}</m>. This is the number of days that it rained. We want the non-rainy days which is 47-7.9994=39.0006 We round that as requested to 39.</p>
