<statement>
<p>In 51.28 <percent/> of the last 39 days it rained. How many days did it not rain? <fillin characters="20" /> days</p>
<p><em>Round to the nearest whole.</em></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>19</li></ul></p><p>We recall that a percent as a decimal is part/whole. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{P}}{{39}}={0.5128}</m>. We solve for P by multiplying by <m>\displaystyle{39}</m>. <m>\displaystyle{P}={0.5128}\cdot{39}={19.9992}</m>. This is the number of days that it rained. We want the non-rainy days which is 39-19.9992=19.0008 We round that as requested to 19.</p>
