<statement>
<p>In 64 <percent/> of the last 25 days it rained. How many days did it not rain? <fillin characters="20" /> days</p>
<p><em>Round to the nearest whole.</em></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>9</li></ul></p><p>We recall that a percent as a decimal is part/whole. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{P}}{{25}}={0.64}</m>. We solve for P by multiplying by <m>\displaystyle{25}</m>. <m>\displaystyle{P}={0.64}\cdot{25}={16}</m>. This is the number of days that it rained. We want the non-rainy days which is 25-16=9 We round that as requested to 9.</p>
