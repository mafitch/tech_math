<statement>
<p>In 27.59 <percent/> of the last 29 days it rained. How many days did it not rain? <fillin characters="20" /> days</p>
<p><em>Round to the nearest whole.</em></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>21</li></ul></p><p>We recall that a percent as a decimal is part/whole. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{P}}{{29}}={0.2759}</m>. We solve for P by multiplying by <m>\displaystyle{29}</m>. <m>\displaystyle{P}={0.2759}\cdot{29}={8.0011}</m>. This is the number of days that it rained. We want the non-rainy days which is 29-8.0011=20.9989 We round that as requested to 21.</p>
