<statement>
<p>In 28.57 <percent/> of the last 28 days it rained. How many days did it not rain? <fillin characters="20" /> days</p>
<p><em>Round to the nearest whole.</em></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>20</li></ul></p><p>We recall that a percent as a decimal is part/whole. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{P}}{{28}}={0.2857}</m>. We solve for P by multiplying by <m>\displaystyle{28}</m>. <m>\displaystyle{P}={0.2857}\cdot{28}={7.9996}</m>. This is the number of days that it rained. We want the non-rainy days which is 28-7.9996=20.0004 We round that as requested to 20.</p>
