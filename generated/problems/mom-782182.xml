<statement>
<p>In 35.56 <percent/> of the last 45 days it rained. How many days did it not rain? <fillin characters="20" /> days</p>
<p><em>Round to the nearest whole.</em></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>29</li></ul></p><p>We recall that a percent as a decimal is part/whole. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{P}}{{45}}={0.3556}</m>. We solve for P by multiplying by <m>\displaystyle{45}</m>. <m>\displaystyle{P}={0.3556}\cdot{45}={16.002}</m>. This is the number of days that it rained. We want the non-rainy days which is 45-16.002=28.998 We round that as requested to 29.</p>
