<statement>
<p>In 40.63 <percent/> of the last 32 days it rained. How many days did it not rain? <fillin characters="20" /> days</p>
<p><em>Round to the nearest whole.</em></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>19</li></ul></p><p>We recall that a percent as a decimal is part/whole. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{P}}{{32}}={0.4063}</m>. We solve for P by multiplying by <m>\displaystyle{32}</m>. <m>\displaystyle{P}={0.4063}\cdot{32}={13.0016}</m>. This is the number of days that it rained. We want the non-rainy days which is 32-13.0016=18.9984 We round that as requested to 19.</p>
