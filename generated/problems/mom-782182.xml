<statement>
<p>In 40.74 <percent/> of the last 27 days it rained. How many days did it not rain? <fillin characters="20" /> days</p>
<p><em>Round to the nearest whole.</em></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>16</li></ul></p><p>We recall that a percent as a decimal is part/whole. Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{P}}{{27}}={0.4074}</m>. We solve for P by multiplying by <m>\displaystyle{27}</m>. <m>\displaystyle{P}={0.4074}\cdot{27}={10.9998}</m>. This is the number of days that it rained. We want the non-rainy days which is 27-10.9998=16.0002 We round that as requested to 16.</p>
