<statement>
<p>Find the slope of the line that goes through the points (8,-5) and (2,8).</p>
<p>
Slope, <m>\displaystyle{m}</m> = <fillin characters="20" /></p>
<p>
Enter your answer as an integer or a reduced fraction in the form A/B</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p><m>\displaystyle\frac{{{8}-{\left(-{5}\right)}}}{{{2}-{\left({8}\right)}}}=\frac{{13}}{{-{{6}}}}</m> which reduces to <m>\displaystyle-\frac{{13}}{{6}}</m> (if it's not already reduced)</p>
