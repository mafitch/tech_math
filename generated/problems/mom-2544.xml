<statement>
<p>
NASA launches a rocket at <m>\displaystyle{t}={0}</m> seconds.  Its height, in meters above
sea-level, as a function of time is given by <m>\displaystyle{h}{\left({t}\right)}=-{4.9}{t}^{{2}}+{292}{t}+{129}</m>.
</p>
<p>
(A) Assuming that the rocket will splash down into the ocean, at what time does
splashdown occur? (Round answer to 2 decimal places)
</p>
<p>
The rocket splashes down after <fillin characters="10" /> seconds.
</p>
<p>
(B) How high above sea-level does the rocket get at its peak? (Round answer to 2 decimal places)
</p>
<p>
The rocket peaks at <fillin characters="10" /> meters above sea-level.
