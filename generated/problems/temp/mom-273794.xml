<statement>
<p>
The Richter Scale reading, <m>\displaystyle{R}</m>, of an earthquake is based on a logarithmic equation. Suppose:</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{R}={\log{{\left(\frac{{A}}{{A}_{{0}}}\right)}}}</m> </p>
<p>
where</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{A}</m> - is the measure of the amplitude of the earthquake wave, and </p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{A}_{{0}}</m> - is the amplitude of the smallest detectable wave (or standard wave).</p>
<p>
Suppose an earthquake is measured with a wave amplitude <m>\displaystyle{A}=</m> 0.3602 while the smallest detectable wave <m>\displaystyle{A}_{{0}}</m> is measured at 0.0001 cm. What is the magnitude of this earthquake using the Richter scale, to the nearest tenth?</p>
<p>
The earthquake registered <fillin characters="20" /> on the Richter scale.
