<p>Gwen<rsq/>s Gravel Company supplied a homeowner with 20 cubic yards of gravel for his driveway at a cost of <dollar/>1,730.00.  Assuming they charge the same rate per cubic yard regardless of the amount of gravel supplied, what would they charge for 32 cubic yards of gravel?</p><table><tabular>

    <cell> Translate to a proportion: </cell>
    <cell> <fillin characters="20" />
