<statement>
<p>Suppose you are standing such that a 36.0-foot tree is directly between you and the sun. If you are 4.00 feet tall and the tree casts a 45.00-foot shadow, how far away from the tree can you stand and still be completely in the shadow of the tree? </p><image width="67%"  pi:generated="problems/images/7d771db55fdef5935b757be8037b9277.png" /> <p>The distance between you and the tree is <fillin characters="5" /> ft (Use the rules of working with significant figures to round.)</p>
