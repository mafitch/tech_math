<statement>
<p>The fraction <m>\displaystyle\frac{{1}}{{4}}</m> is equivalent to what percent? <fillin characters="20" /> <percent/></p>
<p>(Do not enter the <percent/> sign)</p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>25</li></ul></p><p>A ratio (of two things) is a fraction. We can convert that to a decimal and that decimal to a percent.</p>
<p>Here that is <m>\displaystyle\frac{{1}}{{4}}\approx{0.25}</m> and <m>\displaystyle{0.25}\times{100}={25}</m>.</p>
<p>Note we can just do <m>\displaystyle{100}\times\frac{{1}}{{4}}</m> as a single operation: this is arithmetically the same.</p>
