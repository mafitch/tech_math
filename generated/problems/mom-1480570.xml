<statement>
<p>In the model <m>\displaystyle{A}={1770}\cdot{\left({2}^{{\frac{{t}}{{41}}}}\right)}</m> what is the percent increase or decrease? <fillin characters="6" /></p>
<p>Note all numbers are scientific measurements.</p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>1.7</li></ul></p><p>The percent increase/decrease is calculated from <m>\displaystyle{2}^{{\frac{{1}}{{41}}}}\approx{1.0170497444436}</m>. Because this is bigger than 1, this is a percent increase and the result is <m>\displaystyle{1.0170497444436}-{1}={0.017049744443627}\approx{0.017}</m> and the percent is 1.7<percent/>.</p>
<p>We round to 2 significant digits because the measurement (exponent) had 2 significant digits.</p>
</solution>
