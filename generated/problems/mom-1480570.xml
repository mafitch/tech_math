<statement>
<p>In the model <m>\displaystyle{A}={1580}\cdot{\left({2}^{{\frac{{t}}{{23}}}}\right)}</m> what is the percent increase or decrease? <fillin characters="6" /></p>
<p>Note all numbers are scientific measurements.</p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>3.1</li></ul></p><p>The percent increase/decrease is calculated from <m>\displaystyle{2}^{{\frac{{1}}{{23}}}}\approx{1.030595544752}</m>. Because this is bigger than 1, this is a percent increase and the result is <m>\displaystyle{1.030595544752}-{1}={0.030595544752009}\approx{0.031}</m> and the percent is 3.1<percent/>.</p>
<p>We round to 2 significant digits because the measurement (exponent) had 2 significant digits.</p>
</solution>
