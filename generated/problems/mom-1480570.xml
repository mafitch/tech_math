<statement>
<p>In the model <m>\displaystyle{A}={1700}\cdot{\left({2}^{{\frac{{t}}{{36}}}}\right)}</m> what is the percent increase or decrease? <fillin characters="6" /></p>
<p>Note all numbers are scientific measurements.</p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>1.9</li></ul></p><p>The percent increase/decrease is calculated from <m>\displaystyle{2}^{{\frac{{1}}{{36}}}}\approx{1.0194406437021}</m>. Because this is bigger than 1, this is a percent increase and the result is <m>\displaystyle{1.0194406437021}-{1}={0.019440643702145}\approx{0.019}</m> and the percent is 1.9<percent/>.</p>
<p>We round to 2 significant digits because the measurement (exponent) had 2 significant digits.</p>
</solution>
