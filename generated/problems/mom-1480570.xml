<statement>
<p>In the model <m>\displaystyle{A}={1930}\cdot{\left({2}^{{\frac{{t}}{{46}}}}\right)}</m> what is the percent increase or decrease? <fillin characters="6" /></p>
<p>Note all numbers are scientific measurements.</p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>1.5</li></ul></p><p>The percent increase/decrease is calculated from <m>\displaystyle{2}^{{\frac{{1}}{{46}}}}\approx{1.0151825179503}</m>. Because this is bigger than 1, this is a percent increase and the result is <m>\displaystyle{1.0151825179503}-{1}={0.015182517950348}\approx{0.015}</m> and the percent is 1.5<percent/>.</p>
<p>We round to 2 significant digits because the measurement (exponent) had 2 significant digits.</p>
</solution>
