<statement>
<p>You and your classmates create 21 paintings to sell at the PTA auction to raise money for your school. In order to pay for the materials you bought to make the paintings, you need to sell each of the paintings for <dollar/>6.25. When transporting the paintings to the auction, one of your parents accidentally drops three of the paintings in the street and they are run over by a garbage truck. What is the new minimum price you need to set for the remaining paintings in order to pay for the materials?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you do not want to collect less money than you paid for the materials. This may affect how you round your answer.
