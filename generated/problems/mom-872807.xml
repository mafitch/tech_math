<statement>
<p>You and your classmates create 21 murals to sell at the PTA auction to raise money for your school. In order to pay for the materials you bought to make the murals, you need to sell each of the murals for <dollar/>5. When transporting the murals to the auction, one of your parents accidentally drops four of the murals in the street and they are run over by a PeopleMover Transit bus. What is the new minimum price you need to set for the remaining murals in order to pay for the materials?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you do not want to collect less money than you paid for the materials. This may affect how you round your answer. <dollar/><fillin characters="4" /></p>

<solution>
<p><ul><li>6.18</li></ul></p><p>We need a new price that still covers the total cost. Total cost is <m>\displaystyle{21}{\left({5}\right)}={105}</m>. After the loss we will have <m>\displaystyle{21}-{4}={17}</m> items to sell. So we need the new price to satisfy <m>\displaystyle{17}{c}={105}</m>. That means we need <m>\displaystyle{c}=\frac{{105}}{{17}}={6.1764705882353}</m> and we will round to 6.18.</p>
