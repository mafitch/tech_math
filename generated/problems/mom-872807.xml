<statement>
<p>You and your classmates create 22 tapestries to sell at the PTA auction to raise money for your school. In order to pay for the materials you bought to make the tapestries, you need to sell each of the tapestries for <dollar/>4.25. When transporting the tapestries to the auction, one of your parents accidentally drops five of the tapestries in the street and they are run over by a garbage truck. What is the new minimum price you need to set for the remaining tapestries in order to pay for the materials?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you do not want to collect less money than you paid for the materials. This may affect how you round your answer.
