<statement>
<p>You and your classmates create 18 self-portraits to sell at the PTA auction to raise money for your school. In order to pay for the materials you bought to make the self-portraits, you need to sell each of the self-portraits for <dollar/>5. When transporting the self-portraits to the auction, one of your parents accidentally drops two of the self-portraits in the street and they are run over by a downtown trolley. What is the new minimum price you need to set for the remaining self-portraits in order to pay for the materials?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you do not want to collect less money than you paid for the materials. This may affect how you round your answer. <dollar/><fillin characters="4" /></p>

<solution>
<p><ul><li>5.63</li></ul></p><p>We need a new price that still covers the total cost. Total cost is <m>\displaystyle{18}{\left({5}\right)}={90}</m>. After the loss we will have <m>\displaystyle{18}-{2}={16}</m> items to sell. So we need the new price to satisfy <m>\displaystyle{16}{c}={90}</m>. That means we need <m>\displaystyle{c}=\frac{{90}}{{16}}={5.625}</m> and we will round to 5.63.</p>
