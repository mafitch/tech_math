<statement>
<p>You and your classmates create 18 self-portraits to sell at the PTA auction to raise money for your school. In order to pay for the materials you bought to make the self-portraits, you need to sell each of the self-portraits for <dollar/>1.25. When transporting the self-portraits to the auction, one of your parents accidentally drops four of the self-portraits in the street and they are run over by a Amtrak train. What is the new minimum price you need to set for the remaining self-portraits in order to pay for the materials?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you do not want to collect less money than you paid for the materials. This may affect how you round your answer.
