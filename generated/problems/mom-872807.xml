<statement>
<p>You and your classmates create 20 self-portraits to sell at the PTA auction to raise money for your school. In order to pay for the materials you bought to make the self-portraits, you need to sell each of the self-portraits for <dollar/>4.75. When transporting the self-portraits to the auction, one of your parents accidentally drops five of the self-portraits in the street and they are run over by a Community Transit bus. What is the new minimum price you need to set for the remaining self-portraits in order to pay for the materials?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you do not want to collect less money than you paid for the materials. This may affect how you round your answer. <dollar/><input type="text" style="width:5.8ch" name="qn0" id="qn0" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1" class="text"/></p>

<solution>
<p><ul><li>6.34</li></ul></p><p>We need a new price that still covers the total cost. Total cost is <m>\displaystyle{20}{\left({4.75}\right)}={95}</m>. After the loss we will have <m>\displaystyle{20}-{5}={15}</m> items to sell. So we need the new price to satisfy <m>\displaystyle{15}{c}={95}</m>. That means we need <m>\displaystyle{c}=\frac{{95}}{{15}}={6.3333333333333}</m> and we will round to 6.34.</p>
