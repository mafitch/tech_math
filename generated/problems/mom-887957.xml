<statement>
<p>A patient's glucose result is suspected to be outside the range of the analyzer, so the techs decide to dilute the sample before running it. 35 microliters of serum is added to 175 microliters of diluent and the diluted sample is analyzed. The analyzer reads that the glucose value of the diluted sample is 55 <m>\displaystyle\frac{{{m}{g}}}{{{d}{L}}}</m> .</p>
<p>What was the ratio the sample was diluted to? </p>
<p><fillin characters="20" />   </p>
<p>What is the glucose value of the original sample? </p>
<p><fillin characters="20" /> <m>\displaystyle\frac{{{m}{g}}}{{{d}{L}}}</m></p>
