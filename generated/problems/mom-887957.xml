<statement>
<p>A patient's glucose result is suspected to be outside the range of the analyzer, so the techs decide to dilute the sample before running it. 45 microliters of serum is added to 180 microliters of diluent and the diluted sample is analyzed. The analyzer reads that the glucose value of the diluted sample is 50 <m>\displaystyle\frac{{{m}{g}}}{{{d}{L}}}</m> .</p>
<p>What was the ratio the sample was diluted to? </p>
