<statement>
<p>
A city's population in the year <m>\displaystyle{x}=</m>1968 was <m>\displaystyle{y}=</m>4,058,000. In 1960 the population was 4,054,800.</p>
<p>
Compute the slope of the population growth (or decline) and choose the most accurate statement from the following:</p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>The population is increasing at a rate of 500 people per year.</li> 
<li>The population is increasing at a rate of 250 people per year.</li> 
<li>The population is decreasing at a rate of 400 people per year.</li> 
<li>The population is increasing at a rate of 400 people per year.</li> 
<li>The population is decreasing at a rate of 250 people per year.</li> 
<li>The population is decreasing at a rate of 500 people per year.</li>
