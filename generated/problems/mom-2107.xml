<statement>
<p>
A city's population in the year <m>\displaystyle{x}=</m>1962 was <m>\displaystyle{y}=</m>1,167,300. In 1953 the population was 1,170,000.</p>
<p>
Compute the slope of the population growth (or decline) and choose the most accurate statement from the following:</p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>The population is decreasing at a rate of 200 people per year.</li> 
<li>The population is increasing at a rate of 300 people per year.</li> 
<li>The population is decreasing at a rate of 450 people per year.</li> 
<li>The population is decreasing at a rate of 300 people per year.</li> 
<li>The population is increasing at a rate of 450 people per year.</li> 
<li>The population is increasing at a rate of 200 people per year.</li>
