<statement>
<p>
A city's population in the year <m>\displaystyle{x}=</m>1969 was <m>\displaystyle{y}=</m>1,990,350. In 1983 the population was 1,989,650.</p>
<p>
Compute the slope of the population growth (or decline) and choose the most accurate statement from the following:</p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>The population is increasing at a rate of 250 people per year.</li> 
<li>The population is increasing at a rate of 50 people per year.</li> 
<li>The population is decreasing at a rate of 150 people per year.</li> 
<li>The population is decreasing at a rate of 50 people per year.</li> 
<li>The population is decreasing at a rate of 250 people per year.</li> 
<li>The population is increasing at a rate of 150 people per year.</li>
