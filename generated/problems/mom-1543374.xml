<statement>
<p>The optimal angle for an extension ladder is <m>\displaystyle{75}^{\circ}</m>. This angle is measured from the middle of the rails (center of a foot). The angle is approximated by placing the feet of the ladder 1/4 the length of the ladder from where the rails rest at the top. The foot of a ladder is about 4" long. When placing the ladder the a person might measure the distance to either edge or the middle of the feet. We ask if this makes a significant difference in the angle.</p>
<p>Suppose the ladder is 154 inches long. For each of the following use the distance from the edge to the middle of the feet to calculate the angle.</p>
<p>If the distance is measured to the middle of the foot, what is the angle? <fillin characters="5"/></p>
<p>
If the distance is measured to the wall side of the foot (so the middle is 2 inches further away), what is the angle? <fillin characters="5"/></p>
<p>
If the distance is measured to the far side of the foot (so the middle is 2 inches closer), what is the angle? <fillin characters="5"/></p>
<p>Does the difference in angle exceed <m>\displaystyle{2}^{\circ}</m> (which would not have a significant safety impact)? </p>
