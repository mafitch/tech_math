<statement>
<p>You and your classmates create 25 self-portraits to sell at the PTA auction to raise money for your school. In order to pay for the materials you bought to make the self-portraits, you need to sell each of the self-portraits for <dollar/>1.25. When transporting the self-portraits to the auction, one of your parents accidentally drops four of the self-portraits in the street and they are run over by a downtown trolley. What is the new minimum price you need to set for the remaining self-portraits in order to pay for the materials?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you do not want to collect less money than you paid for the materials. This may affect how you round your answer. <dollar/><input type="text" style="width:5.8ch" name="qn0" id="qn0" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1" class="text"/></p>

<solution>
<p><ul><li>1.49</li></ul></p><p>We need a new price that still covers the total cost. Total cost is <m>\displaystyle{25}{\left({1.25}\right)}={31.25}</m>. After the loss we will have <m>\displaystyle{25}-{4}={21}</m> items to sell. So we need the new price to satisfy <m>\displaystyle{21}{c}={31.25}</m>. That means we need <m>\displaystyle{c}=\frac{{31.25}}{{21}}={1.4880952380952}</m> and we will round to 1.49.</p>
