<statement>
<p>A man owns stock valued at <dollar/>3,000.00.  One day the stock drops by 7<percent/>, and the next day the gain is the same percentage.  How much money is the stock valued at the end of the second day? <dollar/><input type="text" style="width:5.8ch" name="qn0" id="qn0" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Question 1" class="text"/> </p>


</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>2,985.30</li></ul></p><p>We can calculate in two steps. First, the decrease on the first day is <m>\displaystyle\${3},{000.00}\cdot{0.07}=\${210.00}</m>. This means the value at the end of day 1 is <m>\displaystyle\${3},{000.00}-\${210.00}=\${2},{790.00}</m>.</p>
<p>Second the increase on the second day is <m>\displaystyle\${2},{790.00}\cdot{0.07}=\${195.30}</m>. Notice that we are calculating the percent based on the first days result, not the original amount. The amount at the end of the second day is <m>\displaystyle\${2},{790.00}+\${195.30}=\${2},{985.30}</m>.</p>
