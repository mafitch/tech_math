<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para">Before we can use this model we need to know the parameters <span class="process-math">\(A_G\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> A parameter is not a variable, rather it is a value (number) that we obtain from the circumstances and write into the model (equation) before we do any work. <span class="process-math">\(A_G\)</span> varies by airport, because they are at different altitudes. The rate <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> must be obtained for each plane and is often available in the aircraft’s Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH).</div>
<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para">Final altitude (<span class="process-math">\(A_t\)</span>) and time (<span class="process-math">\(t\)</span>) are the variables which implies that the model shows a relationship between time climbing and how high the plane is.</div>
<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para">In this model everything is added which matches the increase of elevation over time (adding makes the altitude bigger).</div>
<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para">Every linear model (equation) has a rate (the slope <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> in the equation). In this case <span class="process-math">\(m=\frac{C \text{ ft}}{1 \text{ min}}\text{.}\)</span> Every linear model has a shift (the <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> in the equation), which may be zero. In this case <span class="process-math">\(b=A_G\text{.}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b=A_G=0\)</span> is possible because an aircraft can take off from sea level (e.g., float planes). This shift makes sense, because the climb starts at the altitude of the ground: the plane was already shifted up by being at that airport.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="section-linear.html#model-time-to-altitude">in-context</a></span>
