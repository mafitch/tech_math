</div> <div class="para">Note <span class="process-math">\(A_G\)</span> is a parameter, that is, this model depends on the elevation from which the plane begins to climb. This varies by airport (if the climb is started from the ground) or by the situation (if the plane needs to climb from some elevation at which it is flying). The rate <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is also a parameter which must be obtained for each plane and is often available in the aircraft’s Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH). The model states that altitude increases with time, which is why time (<span class="process-math">\(t\)</span>) is the variable.</div> <div class="para">In this model everything is added which matches the increase of elevation over time (adding makes the altitude bigger).</div> <div class="para">Note the same plane will reach a given altitude after different amounts of time depending on how high it was to start with. <span class="process-math">\(A_G\)</span> shifts the model up or down to represent this.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="section-linear.html#model-time-to-altitude">in-context</a></span>
