<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para">When we want a value that is half way between two entries in a table, we can simply average them. However, if we want a value somewhere other than half way in between we must perform an additional calculation.</div>
<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para">What is the stall speed with 10° bank angle with flaps in the Up setting?</div>
<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para logical">
<div class="para">The nearest entries in the table are 0° and 30°. We need to figure out what percent 10 is between 0 and 30. We can use that to calculate the matching number between the table entries (48 and 52). Percent is part/whole which in this case is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{10}{30-0} = \frac{10}{30} = \frac{1}{3}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">We do not need to write this as a percent (it would be approximately 33.3%), because we are just using it to multiply in the next step.</div>
</div>
<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para logical">
<div class="para">We want the speed that is 1/3 of the way between 48 and 52. Again we treat this as a percent problem. We want percent times the whole to calculate the part.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{3} \cdot (52-48) = \frac{4}{3}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">This result is how far above 48, so the speed is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
48+4/3 \approx 49.3 \approx 50.
\end{equation*}

<div class="para">Again we round up for safety.</div>
</div>
<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para">Because there are only 4 knots between the entries, it hardly seems worthwhile to do this work, especially because we round up for safety. There are times however, when this process is useful.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="section-graphing.html#example-table-read-interpolate-third">in-context</a></span>
