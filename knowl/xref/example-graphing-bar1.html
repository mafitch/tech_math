<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para">When Vasya was hired in 2017, she was paid an annual salary of $62,347.23. Her work has been good, so each year she has received raises of $5000.00.</div>
<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para">To represent this data we first need to calculate her salary for each year. We do this by starting with her initial salary, then for each year adding the $5000 raise to the previous year’s salary. This is an <dfn class="terminology">iterative</dfn> process. <a href="section-graphing.html#table-salary-vasya" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/table-salary-vasya.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Table 3.2.18: Vasya’s Salary">Table 3.2.18</a> contains the results. A table is an effective means to represent discrete data like this.</div>
<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para">We will represent her salary over time using the bar graph in <a href="section-graphing.html#figure-read-graph-bar" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/figure-read-graph-bar.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 3.2.19">Figure 3.2.19</a>. Notice the horizontal axis is labeled with years and the vertical axis is labeled in dollars. There is one bar for each year, because her salary was changed only once each year. Bar graphs are a good option for discrete data.</div>
<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para">Consider the bar graph (ignore the table). Can you tell that Vasya’s salary is increasing? Can you tell how much? How might the graph be changed to make information easier to find?</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="section-graphing.html#example-graphing-bar1">in-context</a></span>
