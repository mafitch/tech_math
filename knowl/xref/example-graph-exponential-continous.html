<div class="para">We can plot these points then sketch a curve smoothly through the points.</div>
<div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/images/graph-exponential-continuous.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="Graph of the points in the table above with curve sketched through them"></div>
<div class="para">Starting at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> consider the curve as it extends to the right. We can use the analogy of walking up hill to understand this curve. At <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> we are walking up hill so we are a little slower than on a flat surface. At <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> the height has doubled but so also has the slope (remember the differences are a multiple of the height). Walking the next segment will be more strenuous. At <span class="process-math">\(x=2\)</span> the height has doubled again, so also has the steepness. Now it is too steep to walk. We will need to scramble or use climbing equipment. Generally an exponential curve becomes increasingly steep.</div>
<div class="para">Because the base of this exponential is 2 (i.e., <span class="process-math">\(y=2^x\)</span>) each time we move one unit to the right the height doubles (times 2). The easiest place to see this is from <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{.}\)</span> This is because <span class="process-math">\(y=2^0=1\)</span> and this is true of any base (i.e., <span class="process-math">\(y=a^0=1\)</span> for all bases). That means at <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> the y value will be the base (e.g., <span class="process-math">\(y=2^1=2\)</span>).</div>
<div class="para">Starting back at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> again consider the curve as it extends to the left. We can see that we are walking downhill; we might pick up a little speed. At <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\)</span> it continues downhill to the left but it is not enough to help us maintain a faster speed. At <span class="process-math">\(x=-2\)</span> we can no longer see the downhill (too gentle) though we would notice it if we were on a bike or skateboard. Just as the curve becomes twice as high and also twice as steep as we move the to right, it becomes half as high and half as steep as we go to the left. The inability to “see” the downhill nature illustrates that the exponential to the left begins to look like a horizontal line.</div>
<div class="para">Let’s clarify that last statement. We notice that all values (left and right) are positive. So to the left the curve is going down, but it never crosses zero. It must therefore become increasingly close to zero. This is why it begins to look like a line namely <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span> When one curve becomes increasingly like another we call that second curve (the line <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> in this case) an <dfn class="terminology">asymptote</dfn>.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="section-exponential-graph.html#example-graph-exponential-continous">in-context</a></span>
