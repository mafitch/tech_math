<div class="para">If we start with 16.0 oz of 91.0% alcohol solution, how much water do we add to obtain (at least) 25.0 oz of a 55.0% alcohol solution? These are measurements, so we will round using significant digits.</div>
<div class="para">The concentration (55.0%) is the primary goal here rather than the resulting amount (25.0 oz), because we need “at least” that amount: more is okay. As a result we will set up our calculation based on the desired percent alcohol.</div>
<div class="para">This is a percent problem with the total alcohol unchanged and adding only some amount <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> of water. This matches the previous example, except that we are calculating the amount to add and know the resulting percent. However, we can write essentially the same equation. <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} = \frac{A}{16.0+w}=0.550\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is the amount of alcohol. We do not use the 25.0 oz at this time. We will address that at the end.</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Because all of the alcohol comes from the initial solution, we can calculate the amount of alcohol in the same way as before. <span class="process-math">\((0.910)16.0 \text{ oz} = 14.56 \text{ oz}\text{.}\)</span> Thus we setup</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{(0.910)16.0 \text{ oz}}{16.0 \text{ oz}+w \text{ oz}} &amp; = 0.550.\\
\frac{14.\underline{5}6 \text{ oz}}{16.0 \text{ oz}+w \text{ oz}} &amp; = 0.550 \text{ Multiply to move } w \text{ out of the denominator}\\
14.\underline{5}6 \text{ oz} &amp; = 0.550(16.0 \text{ oz}+w \text{ oz}). \text{ Distribute}\\
14.\underline{5}6 \text{ oz} &amp; = (0.550)16.0 \text{ oz}+(0.550)w. \text{ oz}\\
14.\underline{5}6 \text{ oz} &amp; = 8.80 \text{ oz}+(0.550)w. \text{ oz} \text{ Subtract to isolate } w\\
5.\underline{7}6 \text{ oz} &amp; = (0.550)w \text{ oz}. \text{ Divide to isolate } w\\
\frac{5.\underline{7}6 \text{ oz}}{0.550} &amp; = w.\\
1\underline{0}.47272727 \text{ oz} &amp; \approx w.\\
10 \text{ oz} &amp; \approx w.
\end{align*}
</div>
</div>
<div class="para">This means that to obtain a solution with 55.0% alcohol, we need to add 10 oz of water.</div>
<div class="para">We end up with <span class="process-math">\(16 \text{ oz}+10 \text{ oz} = 27 \text{ oz}\)</span> of new solution. Because we have at least the 25 oz we need, and it is the correct concentration, we have achieved our goal. If we had added less water to get exactly 25 oz we would have had a more concentrated solution than desired.</div>
<div class="para">Also note that the percent alcohol is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{0.910(16.0 \text{ oz})}{16.0 \text{ oz}+10 \text{ oz}}=0.56\)</span> or 56%.  This is not exactly 55% because of the rounding in the calculations. If we needed it to be closer to 55%, we would need to be able to measure more precisely.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="section-mixture.html#example-calculate-dilute">in-context</a></span>
