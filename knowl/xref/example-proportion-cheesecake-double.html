</h4> <div class="para">For a particular cheesecake recipe there is <span class="process-math">\(15\bar{0}\)</span> g of eggs and <span class="process-math">\(150\bar{0}\)</span> g of cream cheese. We will determine how many grams of eggs we need if we double the recipe. This means everything will be in ratio of 2/1.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">The proportion is based on original recipe and doubled recipe. That is every ingredient will be doubled: we must perform the calculation for eggs and cream cheese separately. We want the ratio of number of eggs in the doubled recipe to the number of eggs in the original recipe to be 2/1. Thus</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{2}{1} = \frac{E \text{ g}}{15\bar{0} \text{ g}}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Because the quantity to solve is in the numerator we can simply multiply to isolate that quantity (variable).</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{2}{1} &amp; = \frac{E \text{ g}}{15\bar{0} \text{ g}}.\\
\frac{2}{1} \cdot 150 \text{ g} &amp; = \frac{E \text{ g}}{15\bar{0} \text{ g}} \cdot 150 \text{ g}. \text{ Eliminating the denominator.}\\
\frac{2}{1} \cdot 15\bar{0} \text{ g} &amp; = E\\
30\bar{0} \text{ g} &amp; = E \text{ of eggs}.
\end{align*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para">Note because we are using measurements in grams (mass/weight) we used significant figures for rounding. In commercial recipes (and quality home cooking), weights are used because items like eggs are not uniform in mass. If we always use 3 eggs it might be more or less than we need messing up the food. Also note the 2 and 1 have infinite significant figures (they are exact numbers rather than approximated measurements).</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="section-proportion.html#example-proportion-cheesecake-double">in-context</a></span>
