	<title>Method of False Position</title>

<introduction>
	<p>In this project, we are going to learn about an ancient algebraic technique that is built around correcting guesses. We may gain greater appreciation for the value of <em>wrong</em> guesses and what we can gain from them.</p>
</introduction>

<task><statement>
	<p>Solve the following equation any way you would like. <me>x \left( 1+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4} \right)=14.</me></p>
	<p>Check your answer using technology.</p>
</statement></task>

<task><statement>
	<p>Notice that 12 is the least common multiple of 3 and 4: the denominators. Distribute 12 in the following expression. <me>12 \left( 1+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4} \right).</me></p>
	<p>Is this bigger, equal to, or smaller than 14?</p>
</statement></task>

<task><statement>
	<p>We multiplied by a convenient number, which is not quite right. Because it is multiplication we can scale (multiply) our not quite right guess to make it right. Consider <me>y \cdot 12 \left( 1+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4} \right) = 14.</me> Replace 12 times the sum with your result from the previous step.</p>
	<p>Solve the resulting equation for y.</p>
</statement></task>

<task><statement>
	<p>Note that y is the correction to our guess of 12. Calculate <m>y \cdot 12</m>.</p>
	<p>This will match your original solution. If not, check your calculations.</p>
</statement></task>

<task><statement>
	<p>This method is called <em>false position</em> because it guesses a convenient number which is typically false then corrects it. One of the original motivations for this method was the lack of a useful notation for fractions (it dates to the Sumerians and ancient Egyptians).</p>
	<p>Many people today use similar methods when dealing with fractions. What is a reason people might distribute a convenient number before doing the solving?</p>
