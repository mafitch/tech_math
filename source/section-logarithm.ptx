<title>Logarithm Properties</title>

<introduction>

<p>Consider the two graphs in <xref ref="figure-logarithm-scale-example" />. Note they are the same data drawn with different scales. Write down coordinates for the first three points. Is it easier to be precise using the version on the left or the version on the right?</p>

<p>The graph on the left uses the typical (linear) scale. Specifically on both the x and y axes each tick is the same difference (add 1 unit for each tick or 2 units for each label). The graph on the right is the same data using a logarithmic scale. The x axis is still linear (same as the left), but the y axes is labeled such that each tick is the same product (multiply by <m>10^{-1}</m> for each label).</p>

<p>Logarithms were developed initially to manage data that grows exponentially. Measurement of acidity (pH) and volume (decibel) both use a logarithmic scale. Studies of the human brain indicate that our brains interpret sensory data using a logarithmic scale. For example, a 10 degree temperature change feels like more of change if the temperature is <m>23^\circ</m> F than if it is <m>51^\circ</m> F.</p>

<p>Logarithms also have a connection to drunk pigeons and a Scotsman's bones.</p>

	<title>Definition of Logarithm</title>

	<p>The following definition is commonly used for algebraic uses of logarithms. Note that logarithms are defined here as the opposite of an exponential.</p>

	<definition xml:id="definition-logarithm">
		<title>Logarithm</title>
		<statement><p><m>\log_a(x)=y</m> if and only if <m>a^y=x</m></p></statement>
	</definition>

	<example xml:id="example-logarithm-exponential">
		<introduction><p>Each of the following is a conversion between exponential and logarithmic notation.</p></introduction>
		<task><statement><p><m>\log_2(8)=3</m> is the same as <m>2^3=8</m>.</p></statement></task>
		<task><statement><p><m>\log_5(1/25)=-2</m> is the same as <m>5^{-2}=1/25</m>.</p></statement></task>
		<task><statement><p><m>\log_{10}(\sqrt{10})=1/2</m> is the same as <m>10^{1/2}=\sqrt{10}</m>.</p></statement></task>

	<title>Graphing Logarithms</title>

	<p>We can use <xref ref="definition-logarithm" /> to graph logarithmic expressions. To practice we will graph <m>y=\log_2(x)</m>. As before we will begin by completing a table. First, consider <m>y=\log_2(2)</m>. This can be re-written as <m>2^y=2</m> which tells us that <m>y=1</m>. Second, consider <m>y=\log_2(4)</m>. This can be re-written as <m>2^y=4</m> which tells us that <m>y=2</m>. Because we re-write as <m>2^y=x</m> it is easiest if the <m>x</m> is a power of 2. For example <m>x=2^3=8</m>. This tells us that <m>\log_2(8)=3</m>.</p>
	<p>Note that this last point shows us that the logarithm grows (vertically) forever. If we want the height to be 100, we select <m>x=2^{100}</m>. It also shows us that the climb is very slow (twice as long each time to grow one unit higher).</p>
	<p>Consider next <m>y=\log_2(1)</m>. This can be re-written as <m>2^y=1</m> which tells us that <m>y=0</m>. We can also look at fractions. For <m>y=\log_2(1/2)</m> we have <m>2^y=\frac{1}{2}</m>. This tells us that <m>y=-1</m> because negative exponents mean division.</p>
	<p>Just as the curve grows forever as <m>x</m> increases, these examples show us that it grows forever downward as <m>x</m> approaches zero.</p>

	<p>There are two types of values we did not include in our graph example.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-log-domain-zero">
		<statement><p>What is <m>y=\log_2(0)</m>?</p></statement>
		<solution><p>First we re-write this log as an exponential. <m>2^y=0</m>. We know that no exponent will produce a zero, so there is no solution for this.</p></solution>
	</example>

	<exercise xml:id="exercise-log-domain-negative">
		<statement><p>Re-write <m>\log_2(-4)=x</m> as an exponential. Can you find a number for <m>x</m> that makes this statement true?</p></statement>

	<title>Special Logarithms</title>

	<p>Some logarithms occur sufficiently frequently in applications that they have their own notation.</p>

	<p>Logarithms were developed to manage large numbers base 10. Thus we call base 10 logarithms: <term>common logs</term>. This is written without the base. For example <m>\log(100)=2</m> is the same as <m>\log_{10}(100)=2</m>.</p>

	<p>In science and from mathematics we need another log called the <term>natural logarithm</term>. This is written as <m>\ln(x)</m> (for logarithm natural). Natural logarithms are paired with the base <m>e</m>. So <m>\ln(5)=y</m> is the same as <m>e^y=5</m>. <m>e</m> is a naturally occuring constant. You do not need to memorize an approximation (your calculator can handle that for you). For the curious <m>e \approx 2.1718281828</m>.</p>

	<exercise xml:id="exercise-logarithm-natural-calculate">
		<statement><p>Using technology, calculate <m>\ln(7)</m>.</p></statement>
