<title>Roots</title>

<introduction>

<p>In <xref ref="section-quadratic-solve" /> we solved expressions with quadratics using the square root. Here we will briefly describe roots in general including notation and their rate.</p>

	<title>Definition of Roots</title>

	<p>As implied by their use in solving square roots are an opposite concept to squares. For example <m>3^2=9</m> means that 9 is the result of multiplying 3 by itself. <m>\sqrt{16}=4</m> means that 4 is a number that multiplied by itself is 16. This means in general <me>\sqrt{n^2}=n.</me>.</p>
	<p>There is one detail that we will not use, but should be acknowledged. Note that <m>(3)^2=9</m> and <m>(-3)^2=9</m>. Thus <m>\sqrt{9}</m> might be considered to have two solutions. We saw this in <xref ref="subsubsection-solve-quadratic-formula" />. When solving using inversion as in <xref ref="subsubsection-solve-quadratic-inversion" /> we will ignore the negative solution which will not be useful in the problems asked.</p>

	<title>Generalized Roots</title>

	<p>Just as we can multiply a number by itself (e.g., <m>3^2=3 \cdot 3 = 9</m>) we can multiply a number by itself more than once (e.g., <m>3^3=3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 27</m>). In general <me>3^m = \overbrace{3 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots 3}^m.</me></p>

		<exercise><p><m>4^3</m></p></exercise>
		<exercise><p><m>(1.9)^4</m></p></exercise>
	</exercises>

	<p>Just as there are square roots to solve problems involving squares, there are roots for other powers as well. These are denoted with a small number to show which root. For example this is a third root: <me>\sqrt[3]{8}=2.</me> Just as with square roots we can use a device to calculate the values. The device may have a key like <m>\sqrt[m]{x}</m>.</p>

	<p>Another notation for roots is a type of exponent. For example, <me>\sqrt{9}=9^{1/2}=3.</me> Likewise, <me>\sqrt[3]{8}=8^{1/3}=2.</me> This notation can be used when solving problems with powers.</p>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-root-rate">
	<title>Rates of Roots</title>

	<p>We have compared rates of linear, quadratic, and exponential data (<xref ref="section-rates" />). Here we learn about rates by considering the rate of roots.</p>

	<p>To compare rates see <xref ref="figure-root-rate" />. Notice that the rate is eventuallymuch slower than even a linear. Because a linear is slower than a linear it is also slower than a quadratic or exponential.</p>

	</figure>

	<p>With rates it is important to test if a slow growth rate is leveling off or not. We will show that a square root (and other roots) do not level off. Note in <xref ref="table-root-increase" /> we can produce an arbitrarily large result from a square root. If it leveled off at some number like 2000, we would not have a result larger, but <m>\sqrt{3000^2}=3000</m>. We can do this for any possible height for leveling off. </p>
