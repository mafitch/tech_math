    <p>This section addresses the following topics.
        <ul>
            <li>Interpret data in various formats and analyze mathematical models</li>
            <li>Read and use mathematical models in a technical document</li>
        </ul>
        This section covers the following mathematical concepts.
        <ul>
            <li>Identify rates as linear, quadratic, exponential, or other (critical thinking)</li>
            <li>Identify data varrying directly or indirectly (critical thinking)</li>
            <li>Solve linear, rational, quadratic, and exponential equations and formulas (skill)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p><xref ref="section-rates" /> presents how to determine the rate at which one variable grows with respect to another. In all of those cases we considered only one variable changing. However, many models have more than one variable or parameter, and we wish to analyze the impact each one has on the result. This section will also present one more type of rate.</p>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-analyze-multi-variable-models">
    <title>Analyzing Models with Multiple Variables</title>

    <p>This first example illustrates how a result can be linear with respect to one or more variables and quadratic (or other relationships) with another.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-vary-multi-lift">
        <p>Review <xref ref="model-lift-equation" />. Consider how lift changes with respect to each of the parameters.</p>
        <p>Consider <m>\rho</m> the density of air. If the other parameters remain constant (only density changes), then the model looks like
        <md>
            <mrow>L &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\rho s C_L v^2</mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; = \left( \frac{1}{2} s C_L v^2 \right)\rho </mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; = k \rho.</mrow>
        </md>
        We can see that lift (<m>L</m>) changes linearly with respect to air density (<m>\rho</m>).</p>
        <p>Consider <m>s</m> the surface area of the airfoil (wing or propeller). If the other parameters remain constant (only surface area changes), then the model looks like
        <md>
            <mrow>L &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\rho s C_L v^2</mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; = \left( \frac{1}{2} \rho C_L v^2 \right)s </mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; = k s.</mrow>
        </md>
        We can see that lift (<m>L</m>) changes linearly with respect to surface area (<m>s</m>).</p>
        <p>Consider <m>C_L</m> the coefficient of lift of the airfoil. If the other parameters remain constant, then the model looks like
        <md>
            <mrow>L &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\rho s C_L v^2</mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; = \left( \frac{1}{2} \rho s v^2 \right)C_L </mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; = k C_L.</mrow>
        </md>
        We can see that lift (<m>L</m>) changes linearly with respect to the coefficient of lift (<m>C_L</m>).</p>
        <p>Consider <m>v</m> the velocity. If the other parameters remain constant, then the model looks like
        <md>
            <mrow>L &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\rho s C_L v^2</mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; = \left( \frac{1}{2} \rho s C_L \right)v^2 </mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; = k v^2.</mrow>
        </md>
        We can see that lift (<m>L</m>) changes quadratically with respect to velocity (<m>v^2</m>).</p>
        <p>How can we apply this knowledge? Lift changes linearly with respect to all parameters except for velocity. If greater lift (to handle greater weight) is needed, velocity provides bigger bang for our buck than any other change.</p>
    </example>

    <p>This second example has us look at the impact on more than just one variable. It also introduces a new relationship.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-vary-multi-gas">
        <p>Review <xref ref="model-lift-equation" />.</p>
        <p>First consider the impact temperature (<m>T</m>) has on pressure (<m>P</m>). If the other parameters remain constant, then the model looks like
        <md>
            <mrow>PV &amp; = nRT.</mrow>
            <mrow>P &amp; = \frac{nRT}{V}.</mrow>
            <mrow>P &amp; = \frac{nR}{V}T.</mrow>
            <mrow>P &amp; = kT.</mrow>
        </md> Pressure (<m>P</m>) grows linearly with respect to temperature.</p>
        <p>Notice that we can write that last equation at <m>\frac{1}{k}P = T</m> which means we can also make the reverse statement: temperature increases linearly with pressure.</p>
        <p>Next consider the impact temperature (<m>T</m>) has on volume (<m>V</m>). If the other parameters remain constant, then the model looks like
        <md>
            <mrow>PV &amp; = nRT.</mrow>
            <mrow>V &amp; = \frac{nRT}{P}.</mrow>
            <mrow>V &amp; = \frac{nR}{P}T.</mrow>
            <mrow>V &amp; = kT.</mrow>
        </md> Volume (<m>V</m>) also grows linearly with respect to temperature.</p>
        <p>Finally consider the impact volume (<m>V</m>) has on pressure (<m>P</m>). If the other parameters remain constant, then the model looks like
        <md>
            <mrow>PV &amp; = nRT.</mrow>
            <mrow>P &amp; = \frac{nRT}{V}.</mrow>
            <mrow>P &amp; = (nRt)\frac{1}{V}.</mrow>
            <mrow>P &amp; = k \cdot \frac{1}{V}.</mrow>
        </md> This pattern is not linear (nor quadratic, nor exponential). If volume is increased the right hand side will decrease (dividing by a larger number). This means that pressure will decrease. Conversely if volume is decreased the right hand side will increase (divide by a smaller number). This means that pressure will increase.</p>

    </definition>

    <p><xref ref="example-vary-ohm" /> illustrated a model  where the increase in one variable caused a decrease in the other. We used an experiment (plugging in numbers) to discover the inverse relationship.</p>

    <p>If two quantities vary directly, the model may be  linear or quadratic. If two quantities vary inversely, the model may be neither linear nor quadratic. In contrast the next example illustrates two quantities can vary inversely, and the model is still exponential.</p>

    <title>More Model Usage</title>

    <p>For some problems it makes sense to look at these another way. Consider the situation in <xref ref="figure-hydraulic-press" />. The pressure exerted on a fluid by a piston is the ratio of the force exerted and the area of the piston. On the left that is <m>P=\frac{F_1}{A_1}</m>. The same is true on the right <m>P=\frac{F_2}{A_2}</m>. Because the hydraulic fluid is contiguous the pressure is the same on both sides. Thus <me>\frac{F_1}{A_1} = \frac{F_2}{A_2}</me>.</p>

        <solution><p>Notice this is a proportion problem. We can use the relationship

    <p>Next lets consider how changing the size of the second piston affects the force.</p>

            </md></p>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-model-limitations-think-first">
    <title>Limitations of Models</title>

    <p>In <xref ref="example-vary-multi-gas" /> we solved the model equation to see how one value changes with respect to another. We considered how temperature impacts pressure if the other properties do not change. We also considered how temperature impacts volume if the other properties do not change. We might ask how how volume impacts temperature if the other properties do not change.</p>
    <p>We will not however, because this is impossible. If volume is reduced (e.g., we press down on the handle of a tire pump and do not let the air out), then the pressure will increase. There is no way around that. The increase of pressure will then result in an increase of temperature. This still matches the model we have.</p>
    <p>When using a model, mathematics is used to understand what is meant, but we must understand some of the background so we do not draw false conclusions.</p>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-variation-percent-mixture">
    <title>Another Mixture Problem</title>

    <p>In <xref ref="section-mixture" /> we learned to calculate percents for mixtures and how to dilute a mixture to a specified percent.</p>

    <p>By adding water we can of course not increase the percent alcohol, so 91% is the highest we can achieve. If we add enough water we can dilute it to as little as we want. That requires not restricting the final volume. This should make us wonder about a relationship between the desired volume and the minimum/maximum amount of alchol.</p>

    <p>This first question is the same as <xref ref="example-calculate-dilute" />. Use it to check your understanding of the process.</p>

    <exercise xml:id="exercise-calculate-dilute">
        <webwork>
            <statement><p>Suppose we want 20.0 oz of 70.0% alcohol solution. How much water should we add? <var name="'4.9'" width="4" /> How much solution will we have? <var name="'20.9'" width="4" /></p></statement>
            <solution><p>This is a percent problem with the total alcohol unchanged (<m>(0.91)16=14.56</m>) and adding only some amount <m>w</m> of water. Thus we setup
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\frac{(0.910)16.0}{16.0+w} \amp = 0.700</mrow>
                        <mrow>(0.910)16.0 \amp = 0.700(16.0+w)</mrow>
                        <mrow>(0.910)16.0 \amp = (0.700)16.0+(0.700)w</mrow>
                        <mrow>14.6 \amp = 11.2+(0.700)w</mrow>
                        <mrow>3.4 \amp = (0.700)w</mrow>
                        <mrow>\frac{3.4}{0.700} \amp = w</mrow>
                        <mrow>4.9 \amp \approx w</mrow>
                    </md>
                Thus we end up with <m>16+4.9=20.9</m> oz of the new solution.</p>
            <p>We can confirm this work by calculating the percent water. The percent alcohol is <me>\frac{0.910(16.0)}{16.0+4.9}=0.70</me> which is 70%.</p></solution>
        </webwork>
    </exercise>

    <p>Next we will illustrate that for a desired volume, we cannot obtain every percent.</p>

    <exercise xml:id="exercise-calculate-dilute2">
        <webwork>

            </statement>
        </webwork>
    </exercise>

    <p>Notice that we did not produce 25 oz but a little less. One question we can ask then is <q>what is the percent alcohol solution we can obtain for a given volume?</q></p>

        <title>Exact Volume Dilution</title>

        <statement><p>If we start with 16.0 oz of 91.0% alcohol solution and we want exactly 20.0 oz of solution, what is the percent alcohol we can obtain?</p></statement>
        <solution><p>If we call the percent alcohol <m>P</m> then the percent water is <m>(1-P)</m>. Thus the final solution will have <me>(1-P)20.0 \text{ oz}</me> of water. We already have <me>0.0900 \cdot 16.0 = 1.44 \text{ oz}</me> of water. Thus we need <me>(1-P)20.0-1.44</me> oz of water. The total volume then will be <me>(1-P)20.0-1.44+16.0=20.0 \text{ oz}</me> Solving this tells us the percentage possible is

            <mrow>(1-P)20.0-1.44+16.0 &amp; = 20.0</mrow>
            <mrow>(1-P)20.0 +14.6 &amp; = 20.0</mrow>

            <mrow> P &amp; \approx 0.73</mrow>

        Thus the percent we obtain for exactly 20.0 oz is 73%.</p></solution>
