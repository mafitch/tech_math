<title>Medical Ratios</title>

<introduction>

	<p>A common application of ratios in medicine is creating drugs of a desired strength. For example some drugs need to be administered based on the body weight of he patient. This requires the medical personnel to mix the drug they have on hand to the needed strength.</p>

	<p>We will work the following three types of medical problems.
		<ul>
			<li>Measure drug concentration</li>
			<li>Dilute a drug to a lower concentration</li>
			<li>Determine how much drug to use</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

</introduction>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-dilution-terminology" >
	<title>Terminology</title>

	<p>The active ingredient in a drug is often added to a inactive ingredient (often liquid) to administer it. This liquid is known as a <term>diluent</term>. The diluent might be water, saline solution, or other substances.</p>

	<p>Even if the drug can be administered directly (e.g., is already liquid) we sometimes need to dilute the <term>stock solution</term> (undiluted drug) for ease of use.</p>

	<p>In some problems the drug mixture will be divided into parts. These parts are sometimes called <term>aliquots</term>. For example when testing substances (like blood samples) we may divide the total amount into aliquots for each test to be run.</p>

	<p>The most important concept is measuring how concentrated a solution is. There are three ways this information can be written.
		<ul>
			<li>Ratio of concentrated drug to diluent, e.g., 1:4</li>
			<li>Ratio of concentrated drug to total, e.g., 1:5</li>
			<li><term>Dilution Factor</term>, e.g., 5</li>
			<li><term>Percent concentration</term>, e.g., 20%</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<example xml:id="example-dilution-factor-terminology">
		<p>Suppose we add 500 mL of water to 100 mL of a concentrated solution of hydrochloric acid.
			<ul>
				<li>The ratio of solution to diluent is <m>\frac{100}{500}</m></li>
				<li>The ratio of solution to total is <m>\frac{100}{600}</m></li>
				<li>The dilution factor is <m>\frac{600}{100} = 6</m></li>
				<li>The percent concentration is <m>\frac{100}{600} \cdot 100 = 16.7\%</m></li>
			</ul>
		Note this is about diluting the solution, not about determining the concentration of acid in diluent. We need more information for that.</p>
	</example>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-medicine-concentration">
	<title>Making Solutions</title>

	<p>A solution of a desired concentration can be produced to have a desired percent concentration. Note be careful in each problem to determine if this is by weight or by volume. The result can be significantly different.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-hcl-concentration">
		<statement>
			<p>A standard concentration of HCl (hydrochloric acid) is 37% by weight. This means that there are 37 g of HCl (in gas form) per every 100 g of solution. The solvent is water. A 37% solution of HCl is known to have 1190 grams per liter. How much water in volume do we need to add to the 37 g of HCl to make this solution?</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>Because the concentration is 37 g of HCl per 100 g of solution we need 100g - 37g = 63 g of water. 1 g of water at standard conditions fills 1 mL. This is now a unit conversion problem.
				<me>63 g \cdot \frac{1 \text{ mL}}{1 \text{ g}} = 63 \text{ mL}</me>.</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<p>Solutions are sometimes diluted by a specified amount to produce a less concentrated version. First, we will practice calculating dilution factors.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-calculate-dilution-factor">
		<statement><p>A solution is produced from 3 mL of concentrated chloroform and 37 mL of water. What is the dilution factor?</p></statement>
		<solution><p>The dilution factor is the ratio of the total to the substance. The total is substance plus diluent. Here that is <m>3+37=40</m>. The ratio then is <m>\frac{40}{3} \approx 13</m>.</p></solution>
	</example>

	<example xml:id="example-make-dilution-factor">
		<statement><p>To produce a solution 3 mL of concentrated chloroform that will have a dilution factor of 50, how much diluent do we add?</p></statement>
		<solution><p>The dilution factor is the ratio of the total to the substance. The total is substance plus diluent. In this case we have
		<md>
			<mrow>3+D \amp = 50.</mrow>
			<mrow>D \amp =47.</mrow>
		</md>
		So we need 47 mL of diluent.</p></solution>
	</example>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-dilution" >
	<title>Dilution</title>

	<p>One usage of dilution is to reduce the concentration so that instruments can accurately measure it. Consider trying to measure an acid without disolving the tools used to measure it.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-dilute-measure">
		<statement><p>A sample of a suspected high blood glucose value was obtained. According to the manufacturer of the instrument used to read blood glucose values, the highest glucose result which can be obtained on this particular instrument is 500 mg/dL. When the sample was run, the machine gave an error message (concentration too high).</p>
		<p>The serum was diluted to 1/10 and retested. The machine gave a result of 70 mg/dL. What was the initial concentration?</p></statement>
		<solution><p>Before we jump into an equation, let's try an experiment. Suppose we take 1 dL of the original serum. To dilute to a ratio of 1/10 we need to add <m>10-1=9</m> dL of diluent. No blood glucose was added thus the concentration is changed only by the diluent. Thus the concentration of the diluted serum would be
		<md>
			<mrow>\frac{C+0 \text{ mg}}{1+9 \text{ dL}} \amp = \frac{70 \text{ mg}}{\text{dL}}</mrow>
			<mrow>\frac{C \text{ mg}}{10 \text{ dL}} \amp = \frac{70 \text{ mg}}{\text{dL}} \amp \text{ clearing the denominators}</mrow>
			<mrow>(C \text{ mg})(\text{dL}) \amp = (70 \text{ mg})(10 \text{ dL})</mrow>
			<mrow>\frac{(C \text{ mg})(\text{dL})}{\text{dL}} \amp = \frac{(70 \text{ mg})(10 \text{ dL})}{\text{dL}}</mrow>
			<mrow>C \amp = \frac{700 \text{ mg}}{\text{ dL}}</mrow>
		</md>
		Did this result depend on our selecting 1 dL of the original serum? If we are uncertain we can try the problem again and select 2 dL of the original serum. This means we need to add enough diluent to get the 1/10 ratio.
		<me>\frac{1}{10} = \frac{2}{20}</me>
		This means we need <m>20-2=18</m> dL of diluent to have the desired dilution ratio. Also we will have twice as much of the blood glucose.
		<md>
			<mrow>\frac{2C+0 \text{ mg}}{2+18 \text{ dL}} \amp = \frac{70 \text{ mg}}{\text{dL}}</mrow>
			<mrow>\frac{2C \text{ mg}}{20 \text{ dL}} \amp = \frac{70 \text{ mg}}{\text{dL}} \amp \text{ clearing the denominators}</mrow>
			<mrow>(2C \text{ mg})(\text{dL}) \amp = (70 \text{ mg})(20 \text{ dL})</mrow>
			<mrow>\frac{(2C \text{ mg})(\text{dL})}{2 \text{dL}} \amp = \frac{(70 \text{ mg})(20 \text{ dL})}{2 \text{dL}}</mrow>
			<mrow>C \amp = \frac{700 \text{ mg}}{\text{ dL}}</mrow>
		</md>
		Notice the result is the same. This makes sense, because we are setting up a ratio and they don't depend on the amount.</p></solution>
	</example>

	<p>Sometimes we dilute more than one time. Here we experiment to determine what the effect of <term>serial dilution</term> is upon the dilution factor.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-serial-dilution">
		<statement><p>Suppose you have a solution consisting of 10 mL of acyl chloride and 90 mL of water. If this is diluted to a dilution ratio of 1/2 and then diluted again to a dilution ratio of 1/3, what is the final dilution ratio?</p></statement>
		<solution><p>We can do the calculations one at a time.
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{10 \text{ mL}}{10+90 \text{ mL}} \amp = \frac{10}{100}</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{10}.</mrow>
			</md>
			To dilute to a ratio of 1/2 we can calculate the amount of diluent to add
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{1}{2} \amp = \frac{100 \text{ mL}}{T \text{ mL}}</mrow>
				<mrow>1 \cdot (T \text{ mL}) \amp = 2 \cdot (100 \text{ mL})</mrow>
				<mrow>T \amp = 200 \text{ mL}.</mrow>
			</md>
			The total will be 200 mL so we need to add 100 mL of additional diluent. Note at this point the concentration is
			<me>\frac{10}{200} = \frac{1}{20}.</me>
			To dilute again to a ratio of 1/3 we can calculate the amount of diluent to add
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{1}{3} \amp = \frac{200 \text{ mL}}{T \text{ mL}}</mrow>
				<mrow>1 \cdot (T \text{ mL}) \amp = 3 \cdot (200 \text{ mL})</mrow>
				<mrow>T \amp = 600 \text{ mL}.</mrow>
			</md>
			The total will be 600 mL so we need to add 400 mL of additional diluent. Note at this point the concentration is
			<me>\frac{10}{600} = \frac{1}{60}.</me>
			Now we can determine what the resulting dilution ratio after diluting twice (1/2 and then 1/3).
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{1}{10} \cdot F \amp = \frac{1}{60} \amp \text{ clear the denominator on the left}</mrow>
				<mrow>10 \cdot \frac{1}{10} \cdot F \amp = 10 \cdot \frac{1}{60}.</mrow>
				<mrow>F \amp = \frac{1}{6}.</mrow>
			</md>
			Notice that <m>\frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3}</m>. This relationship is always true for serial dilution.</p></solution>

	<title>Dosage</title>

	<p>If we know the concentration of a drug, we can determine how much is needed for a given dose.</p>

	<p>In medicine some substances are measured in <term>International Unit</term> or IU. For each substance this is defined by the effect of that amount of the drug.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-dosage-insulin">
		<statement>
			<p>One IU of insulin is 0.0347 mg. A common concentration of insuline is U-100 which is 100 IU/mL. This is produced by combining 100 units of insulin in one mL of diluent.</p>
			<p>If a person needs 2 units of insulin, how many mL of solution will that be?</p>

			<p>This is a unit conversion problem. We need to convert from IU to mL. We know the ratio is 100 IU/mL. Because we want to end up with mL, we will write the ratio as

			<p>This is also a unit conversion problem.  We need to convert from drops per minute to drops per mL.
