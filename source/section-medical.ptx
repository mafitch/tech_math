<title>Medical Ratios</title>

<introduction>
	<p>This section addresses the topics
		<ul>
			<li>Interpret data in various formats and analyze mathematical models</li>
			<li>Read and use mathematical models in a technical document</li>
		</ul>
		and covers the mathematical concepts
		<ul>
			<li>Setup and solve proportions (skill)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>A common application of ratios in medicine is creating drugs of a desired strength. For example some drugs need to be administered based on the body weight of the patient. This requires the medical personnel to mix the drug they have on hand to the needed strength.</p>

	<p>We will work the following three types of medical problems.
		<ul>
			<li>Measure drug concentration</li>
			<li>Dilute a drug to a lower concentration</li>
			<li>Determine how much drug to use</li>
		</ul>
	Each of these is a type of problem already covered (ratio, percent, or proportion). We need only recognize which type and use those methods.</p>

</introduction>

	<title>Terminology</title>

	<p>This section defines terminology used in medicine and sciences about solution concentrations. They are examples of how ratios can present the relationship between quantities in different ways. Being able to change between the different presentations of concentration will demonstrate your ability to understand and use ratios accurately.</p>

	<p>The active ingredient in a drug is often added to a inactive ingredient (often liquid) to administer it. This liquid is known as a <term>diluent</term>. The diluent might be water, saline solution, or other substances.</p>

	<p>The substance (active ingredient for medicine) which may be a powder or another liquid to which the diluent is added is called the <term>solute</term>. The solute is disolved in the diluent. For example salt (solute) is disolved in water (diluent) to make saline solution.</p>

	<p>Even if the drug can be administered directly (e.g., is already liquid) we sometimes need to dilute the <term>stock solution</term> (undiluted drug) for ease of use.</p>

	<p>In some problems the drug mixture will be divided into parts. These parts are sometimes called <term>aliquots</term>. For example when testing substances (like blood samples) we may divide the sample drawn into multiple aliquots, one for each test to be run.</p>

	<p>The most important concept is measuring how concentrated a solution is. This enables providing sufficient and safe amounts of drugs. There are three common ways concentration is written.</p>

	<definition xml:id="definition-dilution-ratio">
		<title>Dilution Ratio</title>
		<statement>
			<p>The <term>Dilution Ratio</term> is the ratio of solute (drug) to diluent.</p>
			<p>If the solute is a liquid, then this is in units of volume per volume (e.g., mL per mL). For example a dilution ratio of 1:4 means 1 mL of drug to 4 mL of diluent giving 5 mL of solution.</p>
			<p>This expression of concentration is unlikely to be used for dry solutes.</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<definition xml:id="definition-dilution-factor">
		<title>Dilution Factor</title>
		<statement>
			<p>The <term>Dilution Factor</term> is the ratio of solute (drug) to the resulting solution.</p>
			<p>If the solute is liquid, then this is in units of volume per volume. For example a dilution factor of 5 means 1 unit of the drug in every 5 units of solution implying 4 units of diluent (1/4 dilution ratio).</p>
			<p>If the solute is solid (e.g, powder) then this is in units of mass per volume. For example, 5 g of drug in a total of 100 mL of solution. Note we do not care how much diluent was added (hence we cannot calculate dilution ratio). This dilution factor can be achieved by putting in the dry ingredient, then adding part of the diluent to disolve the dry ingredient, then pouring in enough additional diluent to reach the desired volume.</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<definition xml:id="definition-percent-concentration">
		<title>Percent Concentration</title>
		<statement>
			<p>The <term>Percent Concentration</term> is the ratio of mass of solute (drug) to 100 mL of diluent.</p>
			<p>If the solute is liquid, then this is in units of volume per volume. For example if the are 2 mL of drug per 100 mL of solution, then the percenet concentration is 2/100 or 2%.</p>
			<p>If the solute is solid (e.g, powder) then this is in units of mass per volume. For example, if there are 2 mg of drug per 100 mL of solution, then the percent concentration is 2/100 or 2%. Note this is neither percent by volume nor percent by mass as would be used in science.</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>These examples illustrate the meaning of these terms.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-solutions-terminology-dry">
		<p>Saline solution consists of the solute salt (sodium chloride) disolved in the diluent pure water.</p>
		<p>The saline solution used in medical applications is 9 g of the solute salt, which is a solid, disolved in enough water to make 1 liter of solution. We know 1 liter is 1000 milliliter (<xref ref="table-metric-sizes" text="custom">metric terminology</xref>). The dilution factor is 9/1000. The percent concentration is <m>\frac{9}{1000}=0.009</m> or 0.9%.</p>
	</example>

	<example xml:id="example-solutions-terminology-wet">
		<p>Clorox<registered/> Disinfection Bleach contains 7.0% sodium hypochlorite which is a liquid, i.e., the percent concentration is 7.0%. In 11 oz of bleach solution there is therefore <m>11 \cdot 0.070 = 0.77</m> oz of sodium hypochlorite. This means <m>11-0.77=10.23</m> oz is water. Thus the dilution ratio is <m>\frac{0.77}{10.23} \approx \frac{1}{13.29}</m> and the dilution factor is <m>\frac{0.77}{11}</m> or 0.7.</p>
		<p>Converting from <m>0.77/10.23</m> to <m>1/13.29</m> generally makes the ratio easier to read. We can perform this conversion multiple ways.</p>
		<p><md>

	<title>Dilution</title>

	<p>This section shows how to use knowledge of proportions to perform calculations required in medicine. Dilution ratios or factors tell us a desired ratio, and we know the initial ratio. This pair allows us to setup a proportion.</p>

	<p>This first example shows how to produce a solution with a desired dilution factor.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-make-dilution-factor">
		<statement><p>How much diluent do we need to add to produce a solution containing 3.0 mL of concentrated chloroform that will have a dilution factor of <m>5\bar{0}</m>?</p></statement>
		<solution><p>The dilution factor is the ratio of the total to the substance. We want that to equal <m>5\bar{0}</m>, so we can write the proportion <me>\frac{\text{total}}{\text{solute}}=\frac{5\bar{0}}{1}.</me>.</p>
		<p>We are not given the total volume, but the total is the volume of the solute plus the volume of the diluent. We do know the volume of solute (3.0 mL), and the volume of diluent is what we want to calculate. We can call the volume of diluent <m>D</m>. The volume of the solution is <m>3.0+D</m> where <m>D</m> is the volume of diluent to add.</p>
		<p>Because we are starting with 3.0 mL of concentrated chloroform (no dilution) our proportion is
		<md>
			<mrow>\frac{3.0+D}{3.0} \amp = \frac{5\bar{0}}{1.0}.</mrow>
			<mrow>3.0 \cdot \frac{3.0+D}{3.0} \amp = 3.0 \cdot \frac{5\bar{0}}{1.0}.</mrow>
			<mrow>3.0+D \amp = 150.</mrow>
			<mrow>-3.0+3.0+D \amp = -3.0+150.</mrow>
			<mrow>D \amp = 147.</mrow>
		</md>
		So we need 147 mL of diluent. Notice once we had the proportion set up we needed only use algebra.</p></solution>
	</example>

	<p>This example shows us how to apply a dilution ratio (dilute our solution). We can calculate the resulting dilution factor afterward.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-dilute-to-percent-concentration">
		<p>A doctor orders 120 mL of 50% solution of Ensure every two hours. How much Ensure (liquid) and water is needed?</p>
		<p>50% is a percent concentration. This means the Ensure should be 50% of the total volume (120 mL). <m>120 \cdot 0.50 = 60</m> mL of Ensure. This leaves <m>120-60=60</m> mL of water (diluent).</p>
		<p>The dilution ratio is 1/1, because there is the same volume of solute (Ensure) and diluent (water). The dilution factor is 1/2, because we have 60 mL of Ensure in 120 mL of solution (<m>60/120=1/2</m>).</p>
	</example>

	<p>This final dilution example starts with knowing the resulting dilution ratio and calculating how much it was diluted.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-diluation-ratio-calculate">
		<p>If we know the original ratio of solution to diluent and the resulting ratio of solution to diluent, then we can calculate the dilution ratio.</p>
		<p>Suppose the original solution of HCl and water had a ratio of solution to total of 37/100 and the resulting solution had a ratio of 74/300.
		<md>
			<mrow>\frac{37}{100} r \amp = \frac{74}{300}</mrow>
			<mrow>\frac{100}{37} \cdot \frac{37}{100} r \amp = \frac{100}{37} \cdot \frac{74}{300}</mrow>
			<mrow>r \amp = \frac{2}{3}.</mrow>
		</md>The dilution ratio was 2/3.</p>
	</example>

	<p>One usage of dilution is to reduce the concentration so that instruments can accurately measure it. Consider trying to measure an acid without disolving the tools used to measure it.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-dilute-measure">
		<statement><p>A sample of a suspected high blood glucose value was obtained. According to the manufacturer of the instrument used to read blood glucose values, the highest glucose result which can be obtained on this particular instrument is 500 mg/dL. When the sample was run, the machine gave an error message (concentration too high).</p>
		<p>The serum was diluted to 1/10 and retested. The machine gave a result of 70 mg/dL. What was the initial concentration?</p>
		<p>Note that the ratio is milligrams to decilitres (weight to volume). In these types of problems the amount of substance is so small that it does not affect the volume.</p></statement>
		<solution><p>Before we jump into an equation, let's try an experiment. Suppose we take 1 dL of the original serum. Because the blood sample is so small, we can calculate as if all the volume is the diluent. To dilute to a ratio of 1/10 we need to add <m>10-1=9</m> dL of diluent. No blood glucose was added thus the concentration is changed only by the diluent. Thus the concentration of the diluted serum would be
		<md>
			<mrow>\frac{C+0 \; \text{mg}}{1+9 \; \text{dL}} \amp = \frac{70 \; \text{mg}}{\text{dL}}</mrow>
			<mrow>\frac{C \; \text{mg}}{10 \; \text{dL}} \amp = \frac{70 \; \text{mg}}{\text{dL}} \amp \; \text{clearing the denominators}</mrow>
			<mrow>(C \; \text{mg})(\text{dL}) \amp = (70 \; \text{mg})(10 \; \text{dL})</mrow>
			<mrow>\frac{(C \; \text{mg})(\text{dL})}{\text{dL}} \amp = \frac{(70 \; \text{mg})(10 \; \text{dL})}{\text{dL}}</mrow>
			<mrow>C \amp = 700 \; \text{mg}</mrow>
		</md>
		Did this result depend on our selecting 1 dL of the original serum? If we are uncertain we can try the problem again and select 2 dL of the original serum. To figure out the total amount of which 2 is 1/10, we can treat this like <xref ref="example-ratio-volume" />
		<md>
			<mrow>\frac{1}{10} \amp = \frac{1}{10} \frac{2}{2}</mrow>
			<mrow> \amp = \frac{2}{20}.</mrow>
		</md>
		This means we need <m>20-2=18</m> dL of diluent to have the desired dilution ratio. Also we will have twice as much of the blood glucose.
		<md>
			<mrow>\frac{2C+0 \; \text{mg}}{2+18 \; \text{dL}} \amp = \frac{70 \; \text{mg}}{\text{dL}}</mrow>
			<mrow>\frac{2C \; \text{mg}}{20 \; \text{dL}} \amp = \frac{70 \; \text{mg}}{\text{dL}} \amp \; \text{clearing the denominators}</mrow>
			<mrow>(2C \; \text{mg})(\text{dL}) \amp = (70 \; \text{mg})(20 \; \text{dL})</mrow>
			<mrow>\frac{(2C \; \text{mg})(\text{dL})}{2 \text{dL}} \amp = \frac{(70 \; \text{mg})(20 \; \text{dL})}{2 \text{dL}}</mrow>
			<mrow>C \amp = 700 \; \text{mg}</mrow>
		</md>
		Notice the result is the same. This makes sense, because we are setting up a proportion, and ratios do not depend on the amount.</p></solution>
	</example>

	<p>Sometimes we dilute more than one time. Here we experiment to determine what the effect of <term>serial dilution</term> is upon the dilution factor.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-serial-dilution">
		<statement><p>Suppose you have a solution consisting of 10 mL of acyl chloride and 90 mL of water. If this is diluted to a dilution ratio of 1/2 and then diluted again to a dilution ratio of 1/3, what is the final dilution ratio?</p></statement>
		<solution><p>We can do the calculations one at a time. First we calculate the original concentration.
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{10 \; \text{mL}}{10+90 \; \text{mL}} \amp = \frac{10}{100}</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{10}.</mrow>
			</md>
			To dilute to a ratio of 1/2 we can calculate the amount of diluent to add as a proportion problem like in <xref ref="example-proportion-cheesecake-double" />.
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{1}{2} \amp = \frac{100 \; \text{mL}}{T \; \text{mL}}</mrow>
				<mrow>1 \cdot (T \; \text{mL}) \amp = 2 \cdot (100 \; \text{mL})</mrow>
				<mrow>T \amp = 200 \; \text{mL}.</mrow>
			</md>
			The total will be 200 mL so we need to add <m>200 \; \text{mL}- 100 \; \text{mL} = 100 \; \text{mL}</m> of additional diluent. Note at this point the concentration is
			<me>\frac{10 \; \text{mL acyl chloride}}{200 \; \text{mL diluent}} = \frac{1}{20}.</me>
			To dilute again to a ratio of 1/3 we can calculate the amount of diluent to add
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{1}{3} \amp = \frac{200 \; \text{mL}}{T \; \text{mL}}</mrow>
				<mrow>1 \cdot (T \; \text{mL}) \amp = 3 \cdot (200 \; \text{mL})</mrow>
				<mrow>T \amp = 600 \; \text{mL}.</mrow>
			</md>
			The total will be 600 mL so we need to add <m>600 \; \text{mL} - 200 \; \text{mL} = 400 \; \text{mL}</m> of additional diluent. Note at this point the concentration is
			<me>\frac{10 \; \text{mL acyl chloride}}{600 \; \text{mL diluent}} = \frac{1}{60}.</me>
			Now we can determine what the resulting dilution ratio after diluting twice (1/2 and then 1/3). We set this up like <xref ref="example-diluation-ratio-calculate" />
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{1}{10} \cdot F \amp = \frac{1}{60} \amp \; \text{clear the denominator on the left}</mrow>
				<mrow>10 \cdot \frac{1}{10} \cdot F \amp = 10 \cdot \frac{1}{60}.</mrow>
				<mrow>F \amp = \frac{1}{6}.</mrow>
			</md>
			Notice that <m>\frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3}</m>. This relationship is always true for serial dilution.</p></solution>
