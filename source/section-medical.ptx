<title>Medical Ratios</title>

<introduction>
    <p>This section addresses the following topics.
        <ul>
            <li>Interpret data in various formats and analyze mathematical models</li>
            <li>Read and use mathematical models in a technical document</li>
        </ul>
        This section covers the following mathematical concepts.
        <ul>
            <li>Setup and solve proportions (skill)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>This section uses medical applications, primarily determine medicine dosages, to illustrate the use of ratios including change of units and proportions. In each example look for how the ratio is recognized and how the information provided is used to setup a calculation.</p>

    <p>A common application of ratios in medicine is creating drugs of a desired strength. For example some drugs need to be administered based on the body weight of the patient. This requires the medical personnel to mix the drug they have on hand to the needed strength.</p>

    <p>We will work the following three types of medical problems.
        <ul>
            <li>Measure drug concentration</li>
            <li>Dilute a drug to a lower concentration</li>
            <li>Determine how much drug to use</li>
        </ul>

    <title>Rounding in Medical Applications</title>

    <p>Rounding for medical applications will be dictated by two factors. First, if an amount is more precise than human and/or machine can measure, then that precision is of no value. For example, if the syringe pumps are capable of measuring a hundredth of a milliliter, then we round to a hundredth. Second, a hospital or other medical provider may have a policy.</p>

    <p>Just as with significant digits, rounding will occur solely at the end of a calculation. Intermediate rounding could change a number. Rounding at the end is a practical necessity as noted above.</p>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-dilution-terminology" >
    <title>Terminology</title>

    <p>This section defines terminology used in medicine and sciences about solution concentrations that we need for the ratio examples in this section.</p>

    <p>The active ingredient in a drug is often added to a inactive ingredient (often liquid) to administer it. This liquid is known as a <term>diluent</term>. The diluent might be water, saline solution, or other substances.</p>

    <p>The substance (active ingredient for medicine) which may be a powder or another liquid to which the diluent is added is called the <term>solute</term>. The solute is disolved in the diluent. For example salt (solute) is disolved in water (diluent) to make saline solution.</p>

    <p>Even if the drug can be administered directly (e.g., is already liquid) we sometimes need to dilute the <term>stock solution</term> (undiluted drug) for ease of use.</p>

    <p>In some problems the drug mixture will be divided into parts. These parts are sometimes called <term>aliquots</term>. For example when testing substances (like blood samples) we may divide the sample drawn into multiple aliquots, one for each test to be run.</p>

    <p>The most important concept is measuring how concentrated a solution is. This enables providing sufficient and safe amounts of drugs. There are three common ways concentration is written. These three are examples of how ratios can present the relationship between quantities in different ways. Being able to change between the different presentations of concentration will demonstrate your ability to understand and use ratios accurately.</p>

    <definition xml:id="definition-dilution-ratio">
        <title>Dilution Ratio</title>
        <statement>
            <p>The <term>Dilution Ratio</term> is the ratio of solute (drug) to diluent.</p>
            <p>If the solute is a liquid, then this is in units of volume per volume (e.g., mL per mL). For example a dilution ratio of 1:4 means 1 mL of drug to 4 mL of diluent giving 5 mL of solution.</p>
            <p>This expression of concentration is unlikely to be used for dry solutes.</p>
        </statement>
    </definition>

    <definition xml:id="definition-dilution-factor">
        <title>Dilution Factor</title>
        <statement>
            <p>The <term>Dilution Factor</term> is the ratio of solute (drug) to the resulting solution.</p>
            <p>If the solute is liquid, then this is in units of volume per volume. For example a dilution factor of 5 means 1 unit of the drug in every 5 units of solution implying 4 units of diluent (1/4 dilution ratio).</p>
            <p>If the solute is solid (e.g, powder) then this is in units of mass per volume. For example, 5 g of drug in a total of 100 mL of solution. Note we do not care how much diluent was added (hence we cannot calculate dilution ratio). This dilution factor can be achieved by putting in the dry ingredient, then adding part of the diluent to disolve the dry ingredient, then pouring in enough additional diluent to reach the desired volume.</p>
        </statement>
    </definition>

    <definition xml:id="definition-percent-concentration">
        <title>Percent Concentration</title>
        <statement>
            <p>The <term>Percent Concentration</term> is the ratio of mass of solute (drug) to 100 mL of diluent.</p>
            <p>If the solute is liquid, then this is in units of volume per volume. For example if the are 2 mL of drug per 100 mL of solution, then the percenet concentration is 2/100 or 2%.</p>
            <p>If the solute is solid (e.g, powder) then this is in units of mass per volume. For example, if there are 2 mg of drug per 100 mL of solution, then the percent concentration is 2/100 or 2%. Note this is neither percent by volume nor percent by mass as would be used in science.</p>
        </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>These examples illustrate the meaning of these terms.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-calculate-dilution-factor">
        <introduction><p>A solution is produced from 3 mL of concentrated chloroform and 37 mL of water.</p></introduction>
        <task>
            <p>What is the dilution ratio?</p>
            <p>The dilution ratio is the ratio of the solute to the diluent. We are given both. The dilution ratio is <m>3/37</m>.</p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>What is the dilution factor?</p>
            <p>The dilution factor is the ratio of the total to the substance. The total is substance plus diluent. Here that is <m>3+37=4\bar{0}</m>. The ratio then is <m>\frac{4\bar{0}}{3} \approx 13</m>.</p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>Calculate the percent concentration.</p>
            <p>The percent concentration is the ratio of the solute to the total solution by volume written as a percent. We are given the volume of the solute (3 mL) and have calculated the total volume in the previous task (<m>4\bar{0}</m> mL). Thus the percent concentration is <m>\frac{3}{4\bar{0}} = 0.075</m> which is 7.5%.</p>
        </task>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-solutions-terminology-dry">
        <p>Saline solution consists of the solute salt (sodium chloride) dissolved in the diluent pure water. The saline solution most commonly used in medical applications is 9 g of the solute salt, which is a solid, dissolved in enough water to make 1 liter of solution.</p>
        <p>Because the solution is produced by adding enough water (amount not specified) it is easiest to express the concentration as a dilution factor. For medicine these are most commonly expressed in terms of milliliters, so we will convert units (<xref ref="table-metric-sizes" text="custom">metric terminology</xref>). The dilution factor is <me>\frac{9 \text{ g}}{1 \text{ L}} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ L}}{1000 \text{ mL}}=\frac{9 \text{ g}}{1000 \text{ mL}}. </me></p>
        <p>We can also calculate the percent concentration. To do this we need to express volume in milliliters (percent concentration is ratio of solute to 100 mL). We can use unit conversion from above. The percent concentration is
        <md>
            <mrow>\frac{9 \text{ g}}{1000 \text{ mL}} &amp; =</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{9 \text{ g}}{1000 \text{ mL}} \cdot \frac{1/10}{1/10} &amp; =</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{0.9 \text{ g}}{100 \text{ mL}} &amp; = 0.009</mrow>
        </md> or 0.9%.</p>
        <p>Note how comparing the information provided to the definition showed us we needed to perform a unit conversion. The definitions also stated which number is numerator and denominator and what form to use for a final expression (e.g., percent or fraction).</p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-solutions-terminology-wet">
        <p>Clorox<registered/> Disinfecting Bleach contains 7.0% sodium hypochlorite which is a liquid. This means the percent concentration is 7.0%. From this information we can calculate the dilution ratio and dilution factor.</p>
        <p>One commercially available size of bleach contains 11 oz. To calculate the dilution ratio and dilution factor we need to know the amount of solute (sodium hypochlorite) in the 11 oz. Because it has a percent concentration of 7.0%  there is <m>11 \cdot 0.070 = 0.77</m> oz of sodium hypochlorite.</p>
        <p>This is all we need for the dilution factor which is <m>\frac{0.77}{11}</m>. This would be easier to read if we express it with a denominator of one. We start by converting to a decimal. <m>\frac{0.77}{11}=0.7</m>. Thus the dilution factor is <m>\frac{0.7}{1}</m> expressed in ounces of bleach to ounces of water.</p>
        <p>For the dilution ratio we need the amount of water added. Because the total solution is 11 oz and we know 0.77 oz is bleach, the water is <m>11-0.77=10.23</m> oz. Thus the dilution ratio is <m>\frac{0.77}{10.23}</m>.</p>
        <p>This ratio is hard to interpret. We could express it with the numerator as one to indicate how much diluent is added to one part solute. We can calculate this multiple ways. The first way is to scale the ratio so the numerator is one.</p>
        <p><md>
            <mrow>\frac{0.77}{10.23} \amp = \frac{0.77}{10.23} \cdot \frac{1/0.77}{1/0.77} </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{10.23/0.77}</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp \approx \frac{1}{13.29}.</mrow>
        </md></p>
        <p>Another option is to write this as a proportion. <md>
            <mrow>\frac{0.77}{10.23} \amp = \frac{1}{R}.</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{10.23}{0.77} \amp = \frac{R}{1}.</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{10.23}{0.77} \amp = R.</mrow>
            <mrow>13.28571429 \amp \approx R.</mrow>
            <mrow>13.29 \amp \approx R.</mrow>
        </md></p>
        <p>The ratio <m>\frac{1}{13.29}</m> means there is one ounce of bleach for every 13.29 ounces of water.</p>
    </example>

    <p>Note a pure substance has dilution factor 1/1 (the total volume of the solution is just the volume of the solute). The percent concentration for a pure substance is 100%.</p>

    <title>Dilution</title>

    <p>This section shows how to use knowledge of proportions to perform calculations required in medicine. Dilution ratios or factors tell us a desired ratio, and we know the initial ratio. This pair allows us to setup a proportion.</p>

    <p>This first example shows how to produce a solution with a desired dilution factor.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-make-dilution-factor">
        <p>How much diluent do we need to add to produce a solution containing 3.0 mL of concentrated chloroform that will have a dilution factor of <m>50</m>? Because this is in a medical context, we will round to one milliliter.</p>
        <p>The dilution factor is the ratio of the total to the substance. We want that to equal <m>50</m>, so we can write the proportion <me>\frac{\text{total}}{\text{solute}}=\frac{50}{1}.</me></p>
        <p>We are not given the total volume, but the total is the volume of the solute plus the volume of the diluent. We do know the volume of solute (3.0 mL), and the volume of diluent is what we want to calculate. We can call the volume of diluent <m>D</m>. The volume of the solution is <m>3.0+D</m> where <m>D</m> is the volume of diluent to add.</p>
        <p>Because we are starting with 3.0 mL of concentrated chloroform (no dilution) our proportion is
        <md>
            <mrow>\frac{3.0+D}{3.0} \amp = \frac{50}{1.0}.</mrow>
            <mrow>3.0 \cdot \frac{3.0+D}{3.0} \amp = 3.0 \cdot \frac{50}{1.0}. \text{ Multiply to isolate } D</mrow>
            <mrow>3.0+D \amp = 150.</mrow>
            <mrow>-3.0+3.0+D \amp = -3.0+150. \text{ Subtract to isolate } D</mrow>
            <mrow>D \amp = 147.</mrow>
        </md>
        So we need 147 mL of diluent. Notice once we had the proportion set up we needed only algebra.</p>
    </example>

    <p>This example shows us how to apply a dilution ratio (dilute our solution). We can calculate the resulting dilution factor afterward.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-dilute-to-percent-concentration">
        <p>A doctor orders 120 mL of 50% solution of Ensure every two hours. How much Ensure (liquid) and water is needed?</p>
        <p>50% is a percent concentration. This means the Ensure should be 50% of the total volume (120 mL). <m>120 \cdot 0.50 = 60</m> mL of Ensure. This leaves <m>120-60=60</m> mL of water (diluent).</p>
        <p>The dilution ratio is 1/1, because there is the same volume of solute (Ensure) and diluent (water). The dilution factor is 1/2, because we have 60 mL of Ensure in 120 mL of solution (<m>60/120=1/2</m>).</p>
    </example>

    <p>Working on dilutions is a proportion problem. This next example presents a scenario where we work a dilution problem backwards. Notice that the setup is still a proportion, and the solving is still just the algebra steps needed.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-dilute-measure">
        <p>One usage of dilution is to reduce the concentration so that instruments can accurately measure it. Consider trying to measure an acid without dissolving the tools used to measure it.</p>
        <p>A sample of a suspected high blood glucose value was obtained. According to the manufacturer of the instrument used to read blood glucose values, the highest glucose result which can be obtained on this particular instrument is 500 mg/dL. When the sample was run, the machine gave an error message (concentration too high).</p>
        <p>The serum was then diluted to 1/10 and retested. The machine gave a result of 70 mg/dL. What was the initial concentration?</p>
        <p>Note that the ratio is milligrams to decilitres (weight to volume). In these types of problems the amount of substance is so small that it does not affect the volume.</p>
        <p>Before we jump into an equation, let's try an experiment. That's right, in math we do not have to know what to do when we start. We will try something, learn from it, and maybe revise our approach based on what we learned.</p>
        <p>This is a dilution problem which means we can setup the proportion <me>\frac{\text{solute mg}}{\text{diluent dL}}=\frac{70 \text{ mg}}{\text{dL}}.</me></p>
        <p>We are trying to determine the amount of blood sugar in the sample, so the solute portion is unknown. We also do not have the size of sample taken. We will experiment to see how this affects the problem.</p>
        <p>Suppose we take 1 dL of the original serum. Because the blood sample is so small, we can calculate as if all the volume is the diluent. That is we started with 1 dL and added more to dilute. To dilute to a ratio of 1/10 we need to add <m>10-1=9</m> dL of diluent. No blood glucose was added thus the concentration is changed only by the diluent. Thus the concentration proportion is now
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{C+0 \text{ mg}}{1+9 \text{ dL}} \amp = \frac{70 \text{ mg}}{\text{dL}}</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{C \text{ mg}}{10 \text{ dL}} \amp = \frac{70 \text{ mg}}{\text{dL}}</mrow>
                <mrow>C \text{ mg} \amp = \frac{70 \text{ mg}}{\text{dL}}(10 \text{ dL})</mrow>
                <mrow>C \amp = 700 \text{ mg}.</mrow>
            </md>
        Did this result depend on our selecting 1 dL of the original serum? If we are uncertain we can try the problem again and select 2 dL of the original serum. To figure out the total amount of which 2 is 1/10, we can treat this like <xref ref="example-ratio-volume" />
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{1}{10} \amp = \frac{1}{10} \frac{2}{2}</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = \frac{2}{20}.</mrow>
            </md>
        This means we need <m>20-2=18</m> dL of diluent to have the desired dilution ratio. Also we will have twice as much of the blood glucose.
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{2C+0 \text{ mg}}{2+18 \text{ dL}} \amp = \frac{70 \text{ mg}}{\text{dL}}</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{2C \text{ mg}}{20 \text{ dL}} \amp = \frac{70 \text{ mg}}{\text{dL}}</mrow>
                <mrow>2C \text{ mg} \amp = \frac{70 \text{ mg}}{\text{dL}}(20 \text{ dL})</mrow>
                <mrow>2C \text{ mg} \amp = 1400 \text{ mg}</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{2C \text{ mg}}{2} \amp = \frac{1400 \text{ mg}}{2}</mrow>
                <mrow>C \amp = 700 \text{ mg}</mrow>
            </md>
        The result is the same. This makes sense, because we are setting up a proportion, and ratios do not depend on the amount.</p>
        <p>We can be confident that the original serum sample had a blood glucose level of 700 mg/dL.</p>
    </example>

    <p>Sometimes we dilute more than one time. Here we experiment to determine what the effect of <term>serial dilution</term> is upon the resulting dilution factor.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-serial-dilution">
        <statement>
            <p>Suppose you have a solution consisting of 10 mL of acyl chloride and 90 mL of water. If this is diluted to a dilution ratio of 1/2 and then diluted again to a dilution ratio of 1/3, what is the final dilution ratio?</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>We can do the calculations one at a time. First we calculate the original concentration.
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{10 \text{ mL}}{10+90 \text{ mL}} \amp = \frac{10}{100}</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{10}.</mrow>
            </md>
            To dilute to a ratio of 1/2 we can calculate the amount of diluent to add as a proportion problem like in <xref ref="example-proportion-cheesecake-double" />.
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{1}{2} \amp = \frac{100 \text{ mL}}{T \text{ mL}}</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{2}{1} \amp = \frac{T \text{ mL}}{100 \text{ mL}}</mrow>
                <mrow>200 \text{ mL} \amp = T.</mrow>
            </md>
            The <em>total</em> will be 200 mL so we need to add <m>200 \text{ mL}- 100 \text{ mL} = 100 \text{ mL}</m> of additional diluent. Note at this point the concentration is
            <me>\frac{10 \text{ mL acyl chloride}}{200 \text{ mL diluent}} = \frac{1}{20}.</me>
            To dilute again to a ratio of 1/3 we can calculate the amount of diluent to add
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{1}{3} \amp = \frac{200 \text{ mL}}{T \text{ mL}}</mrow>
                <mrow>1 \cdot (T \text{ mL}) \amp = 3 \cdot (200 \text{ mL})</mrow>
                <mrow>T \amp = 600 \text{ mL}.</mrow>
            </md>
            The total will be 600 mL so we need to add <m>600 \text{ mL} - 200 \text{ mL} = 400 \text{ mL}</m> of additional diluent. Note at this point the concentration is
            <me>\frac{10 \text{ mL acyl chloride}}{600 \text{ mL diluent}} = \frac{1}{60}.</me>
            Now we can determine what the resulting dilution ratio after diluting twice (1/2 and then 1/3).
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{1}{10} \cdot F \amp = \frac{1}{60}</mrow>
                <mrow>10 \cdot \frac{1}{10} \cdot F \amp = 10 \cdot \frac{1}{60}.</mrow>
                <mrow>F \amp = \frac{1}{6}.</mrow>
            </md></p>
            <p>Notice that <m>\frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3}</m>, that is, the resulting dilution factor is the product of the serial dilutions. This relationship is always true for serial dilution.</p>
        </solution>

    <title>Dosage</title>

    <p>If we know the concentration of a drug, we can determine how much is needed for a given dose. These are proportion problems that require change of units.</p>

    <p>In medicine some substances are measured in <term>International Unit</term> or IU. For each substance this is defined by the effect of that amount of the drug.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-scale-dosage-insulin">
        <p>One IU of insulin is 0.0347 mg. A common concentration of insulin is U-100 which is 100 IU/mL. This is produced by combining 100 units of insulin in one mL of diluent.</p>
        <p>If a person needs 2 units of insulin, how many mL of solution will that be?</p>
        <p>This can be solved as a proportion because are asked for an amount that matches a ratio (concentration) which is 100 IU/mL. Because we are solving for a number of mL, we will write the proportion as

        <p>The ratio is desired amount per provided amount. In this case <m>\frac{2 \text{ IU}}{100 \text{ IU}}=\frac{1}{50}=0.02</m> which is 2%. We therefore want 2% of the 1 mL (from 100 IU/1 mL) or 0.02 mL.</p>

    <exercise xml:id="exercise-scale-dosage">
        <myopenmath problem="1450625" />
    </exercise>

    <p>A physician may prescribe a medicine and specify a total amount and a speed at which it should be delivered. For IV's this is called <term>drop factor</term> and is specified as a number of drops per minute. Medical personnel calculate how long to operate the IV so that the total amount of drug prescribed is delivered in the specified time.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-dosage-drop-factor">
        <p>Give 1500 mL of saline solution IV with a drop factor of 10 drops per mL at a rate of 50 drops per minute to an adult patient. Determine how long in hours the IV should be administered.</p>
        <p>The rate is specified in drops and the amount is specified in mL which means we need to convert units. This will be done like <xref ref="example-convert-speed" />. The units suggest we should multiply the conversion ratios as follows.
            <me>\frac{50 \text{ drops}}{\text{minute}} \cdot \frac{\text{mL}}{10 \text{ drops}} = \frac{5 \text{ mL}}{\text{minute}}</me>
        Now that we know the rate in mL, we can set up a proportion so that time calculated per total grams of medication matches the specified rate. Notice how we invert the rate to make the algebra easier.
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{T \text{ min}}{1500 \text{ mL}} &amp; = \frac{1 \text{ min}}{5 \text{ mL}}.</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{T \text{ min}}{1500 \text{ mL}} \cdot (1500 \text{ mL}) &amp; = \frac{1 \text{ min}}{5 \text{ mL}} \cdot (1500 \text{ mL}).</mrow>
                <mrow>T &amp; = 300 \text{ min}.</mrow>
            </md>
        The final step is to convert minutes to hours. This is another unit conversion problem using a conversion from <xref ref="table-customary-convert" />. The units suggest we can multiply the 300 minutes by the conversion ratio.
            <me>300 \text{ minutes} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ hour}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 5 \text{ hours}</me></p>
