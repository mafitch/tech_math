	<title>Percent</title>
	<statement><p>A <term>percent</term> is a ratio of part of something to the whole of that thing that is written as parts per hundred.</p></statement>
</definition>

<example xml:id="example-percent1">
	<statement><p>In a class there are 34 students. Of them 21 are female. The percent is calculated as <me>\frac{21}{34} = 0.6176</me>. This number says there are 61 hundreths (remembering our numbering system), so the percent is written as <me> 61.76\%</me></p></statement>
</example>

<p>Generally this means we calculate <me>100 \times \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}}. </me> </p>

	<title>Calculating Percents</title>

	<example xml:id="example-percent-gender">
		<statement><p>In the class there are 34 students. Of them 13 are male. The percent is calculated as <me> 100 \times \frac{13}{34} = 100 \times 0.3824 = 38.24\%.</me></p></statement>
	</example>

	<exercise xml:id="exercise-percent-part-whole">
		<webwork>
			<statement>
				<p>In another class there are 78 students and 44 percent are female. What percent of the students are female? <var name="'56'" width="4" /></p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>A percent is the ratio of part (44 female) to whole (78 total). So this is <m>\frac{44}{78} \approx 0.56</m>. This is 56 hundreths, so it is 56%</p>
			</solution>
	    </webwork>
	</exercise>

	<p>Note in the first pair of examples we had a whole class of 34 students with 21 female and 13 male. Of course 21+13 = 34, that is the two parts add up to the whole. Because of this 61.76% + 38.24% = 100% as well.</p>

	<p>Sometimes we are given the size of the whole and a percent. We must calculate how many in the part.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-percent-calculate-part">
		<statement><p>In a class of 22 students, 18% are Alaska Native. How many students are Alaska Native?</p></statement>
		<solution><p>We use the same setup as before, but we don't know the part yet.
			<md>
				<mrow>100 \cdot \frac{P}{22} &amp; = 18\%</mrow>
				<mrow>\frac{P}{22} &amp; = \frac{18}{100}</mrow>
				<mrow>P &amp; = 22 \cdot \frac{18}{100}</mrow>
				<mrow> &amp; \approx 3.96.</mrow>
			</md></p>
		</solution>
		<solution><p>We know that a percent is a number out of 100, so we can skip a step from the previous example.
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{P}{22} &amp; = 0.18</mrow>
				<mrow>P &amp; = 22 \cdot 0.18</mrow>
				<mrow>P &amp; = 3.96</mrow>
			</md></p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<p>Sometimes we know the size of a part and what percent it is. We can calculate the size of the whole.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-percent-calculate-whole">
		<statement><p>In a class 2 Alaska Native students make up 6.25% of the class. How many students are in the class?</p></statement>
		<solution><p>Again we use the same setup, but we don't yet know the whole.
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{2}{W} &amp; = 0.0625.</mrow>
				<mrow>2 &amp; = 0.0625 \cdot W.</mrow>
				<mrow>\frac{2}{0.0625} &amp; = W.</mrow>
				<mrow>32 &amp; = W.</mrow>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-percent-increase">
	<title>Percent Increase/Decrease</title>

	<p>A common use of percents is to indicate how much something has increased (or decreased) from one time to the next.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-percent-increase1">
		<statement><p>In spring there were 22 students in a class. In fall there were 34 students in the same class. This was an increase of 34-22=12 students. We can calculate what percent 12 is of 22.
			<me>100 \times \frac{12}{22} = 55\% </me></p>
		</statement>
	</example>

	<p>We say that the class size had a <term>percent increase</term> of 55%. Note this says the <term>increase</term> was 55% of the previous <term>whole</term>.</p>

	<p>We can think of this in another way.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-percent-increase2">
		<statement>
			<p>In spring there were 22 students in a class. In fall there were 34 students in the same class.</p>
			<p>We calculate the percentage the fall class size is of the spring class size. <me> 100 \times \frac{34}{22} = 155\% </me> Because the percent is greater than 100% we know this was an increase. Specifically it was an increase of 55% over the previous semester.</p>
		</statement>
	</example>

	<exercise xml:id="exercise-percent-increase">
		<webwork>
			<statement>
				<p>What is the percent increase or decrease if enrollment in a class was 57 in spring and 81 in fall? <var name="'42'" width="4" /></p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>The ratio is <m>\frac{81}{57} \approx 1.42</m>. Because 81 is greater than 57 this is a percent increase. The increase is 42%.</p>
			</solution>
	    </webwork>
	</exercise>

	<exercise xml:id="exercise-percent-decrease">
		<webwork>
			<statement>
				<p>What is the percent increase or decrease if enrollment in a class was 78 in fall and 38 in spring? <var name="'51'" width="4" /></p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>The ratio is <m>\frac{38}{78} \approx 0.49</m>. Because 38 is greater than 78 this is a percent decrease. Because the new <em>is</em> 49% of the previous the decrease is 100%-49%=51%.</p>
			</solution>

	<title>Limitations</title>

	<p>When presenting data a percent by itself can be deceptive.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-percent-limitation">
		<statement><p>Which of the following do you suppose represents a greater reduction in students?</p>
		<tabular>
			<row><cell>Percent reduction</cell> <cell>Total</cell></row>
			<row><cell>18%</cell> <cell>495</cell></row>
			<row><cell>1.85%</cell> <cell>54</cell></row>
			<row><cell>60%</cell> <cell>5</cell></row>
		</tabular>
		</statement>
		<solution>
					<tabular>
			<row><cell>Percent reduction</cell> <cell>Total</cell>  <cell>Number reduced</cell></row>
			<row><cell>18%</cell> <cell>495</cell> <cell>90</cell></row>
			<row><cell>1.85%</cell> <cell>54</cell> <cell>1</cell></row>
			<row><cell>60%</cell> <cell>5</cell> <cell>3</cell></row>
		</tabular>
		<p>The 18% of 495 represents the largest number of students. The 60% is a higher percent, but because the total is so small it represents very few students. A percent is more useful if we also know the total number.</p>
		<p>Did you calculate 89 for 18% of 495? Compare the following to see why both are reasonable responses. 89 is what percent of 495? 90 is what percent of 495?</p>
		</solution>
