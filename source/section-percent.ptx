<introduction>

    <p>This section addresses the following topics.
        <ul>
            <li>Interpret data in various formats and analyze mathematical models</li>
            <li>Communicate results in mathematical notation and in language appropriate to the technical field</li>
        </ul>

        This section covers the following mathematical concepts.
        <ul>
            <li>Calculate Percentages (skill)</li>
            <li>Understand and interpret percentages (critical thinking)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Percentages are an often convenient way to express the relative size of two quantities such as the number of people who like lemon meringue pie to the number of those who like pie.</p>
    <p>We will learn how to calculate a percent (<xref ref="subsection-percent-examples" />, <xref ref="proportions-calculate-percent" />), how to convert between percents and the numbers (also <xref ref="subsection-percent-examples" />, <xref ref="proportions-calculate-percent" />), how to describe growth in terms of percents (<xref ref="subsection-percent-increase" />,  <xref ref="proportions-interpret-percent" />), and how to recognize what a percent does and cannot tell us (<xref ref="subsection-percent-limitation" />, <xref ref="proportions-interpret-percent" />).</p>

        <title>Percent</title>
        <statement><p>A <term>percent</term> is a ratio of part of something to the whole of that thing that is written as parts per hundred.</p></statement>
    </definition>

    <example xml:id="example-percent-female">
        <title>Calculate a Percent</title>
        <statement>
            <p>In a class there are 34 students. Of them 21 are female. In this case female students is part of the whole (all students). Thus the percent is calculated as <me>\frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} = \frac{21}{34} \approx 0.6176</me>. This number says there are 61 hundreths (remembering our numbering system), so the percent is written as 61.76%.</p>
            <p>Rounding to two (2) decimal places was chosen to illustrate how we convert a ratio in decimal form to a percent. If we were reporting this information, we would most likely round to 62%. This would convey the same meaning, because the difference between 61.76% and 62% for 34 people is less than one person.</p>
        </statement>
    </example>

    <video youtube="gA7tQzn72lg" xml:id="video-example-percent-use-definition" />

    <p>Generally, we calculate a percent by <me>100 \times \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}}. </me> </p>

    <example xml:id="example-percent-male">
        <statement><p>In the class there are 34 students. Of them 13 are male. The percent is calculated as <me> 100 \times \frac{13}{34} = 100 \times 0.3824 = 38.24\%.</me></p></statement>
    </example>

    <p>Now that we have presented two examples of calculating a percent from counts, use the check point below to test that you can setup and calculate one yourself.</p>

    <exercise xml:id="exercise-percent-part-whole">
<!--        <webwork>
            <statement>
                <p>In another class there are 78 students and 44 are female. What percent of the students are female? <var name="'56'" width="4" /></p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>A percent is the ratio of part (44 female) to whole (78 total). So this is <m>\frac{44}{78} \approx 0.56</m>. This is 56 hundreths, so it is 56%</p>
            </solution>
        </webwork> -->
        <myopenmath problem="1436418" />
    </exercise>

    <p>In the first pair of examples we had a whole class of 34 students with 21 female and 13 male. Of course 21+13 = 34, that is the two parts add up to the whole. Because of this 61.76% + 38.24% = 100% as well.</p>

    <p>Sometimes we are given the size of the whole and a percent, and we are interested in calculating how many are in the part.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-percent-calculate-part">
        <p>In a class of 22 students, 18% are Alaska Native. How many students are Alaska Native?</p>
        <p>We use the same setup as before, but we do not know the part yet.
        <md>
            <mrow>100 \cdot \frac{P}{22} &amp; = 18\% \text{ Divide to isolate } P</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{P}{22} &amp; = \frac{18}{100}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{P}{22} &amp; = 0.18 \text{ Multiply to isolate } P</mrow>
            <mrow>P &amp; = 22 \cdot 0.18</mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; = 3.96.</mrow>
        </md></p>
        <p>Notice that 3.96 does not make sense as a result when counting people, so we expect that the correct result is 4. We can confirm this by checking that
        <md>
            <mrow>100 \times \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} &amp; = 100 \times \frac{4}{22}</mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; = 100 \times 0.18181818</mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; \approx 18.18\%</mrow>
        </md>
        This suggests that the original 18% was rounded. Likely it was rounded to the ones position out of convenience.</p>
        <p>We can solve this another way. We know that a percent is a number out of 100, so we can skip a step from the previous example.
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{P}{22} &amp; = 0.18.</mrow>
                <mrow>P &amp; = 22 \cdot 0.18.</mrow>
                <mrow>P &amp; = 3.96.</mrow>

        <title>How to Use an Example: Percents</title>
        <p>Consider the following question.</p>
        <p>If the first chapter of a certain book is 18 pages long and makes up 2% of the book, how many pages does the entire book have?</p>
        <p>Because we see <q>2%</q> we recognize this as a percent problem. Without more information we can begin writing. In <xref ref="example-percent-calculate-whole" /> the first step is writing the definition of percent.
        <me>\frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} = \text{percent}</me>
        In the example 0.0625 is written on the right (in place of percent). In this problem we know the percent is 2. We also know that in a calculation we convert the percent to a decimal. In this case <m>2\% = \frac{2}{100} = 0.02</m>. Thus the next step is
        <me>\frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} = 0.02</me>
        In the next step in the example the entries for part and whole are entered. In this problem the 18 pages is stated as one chapter and is contrasted to the <q>entire</q> book. Thus the 18 is the part. As with the example, the whole is not known so we leave it as a variable.
        <me>\frac{18}{W} = 0.02</me>
        Finally in the example they solve for the variable. Note the steps of solving may vary depending on what we know, so rather than follow the rest of the example step-by-step, we apply our algebra skills.
        <md>
            <mrow>\frac{18}{W} &amp; = 0.02</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{18}{W}W &amp; = 0.02W \text{ Multiply to move } W \text{ out of denominator}</mrow>
            <mrow>18 &amp; = 0.02W</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{18}{0.02} &amp; =  \frac{0.02}{0.02}W \text{ Divide to isolate } W</mrow>
            <mrow>900 &amp; = W</mrow>
        </md>
        Thus we know the entire book has 900 pages.</p>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-percent-increase">
    <title>Percent Increase/Decrease</title>

    <p>A common use of percents is to indicate how much something has increased (or decreased) from one time to the next. In these cases the part is the amount changed and the whole is the original amount.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-percent-increase1">
        <statement><p>In spring there were 22 students in a class. In the following fall there were 34 students in the same class. What was the percent increase? Round the percent to the nearest unit.</p>
        <p>This was an increase of 34-22=12 students. We can calculate what percent the increase of 12 is with respect to the original (spring) class size of 22.
            <me>100 \times \frac{12}{22} \approx 54.545454 \approx 55\% </me>.</p>
        </statement>
    </example>

    <p>We say that the class size had a <term>percent increase</term> of 55%. Note this says the <term>increase</term> was 55% of the previous <term>whole</term>.</p>

    <p>We can think of this in another way.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-percent-increase2">
        <statement>
            <p>In spring there were 22 students in a class. In the following fall there were 34 students in the same class. What is the percent increase in the fall?</p>
            <p>We calculate the percentage the fall class size is with respect to the spring class size. <me> 100 \times \frac{34}{22} = 155\% </me>. </p>
            <p>Because the fall class size (in the role of <q>part</q>) is greater than the spring class size (in the role of whole), the percent ends up being greater than 100%. For percent increase we should always expect a percent greater than 100%.</p>
            <p>Because this is 55% greater than 100%, the percent increase was 55% over the previous semester.</p>
            <image source="images/percent_increase" width="50%" />
        </statement>
    </example>

    <exercise xml:id="exercise-percent-increase">
<!---       <webwork>
            <statement>
                <p>What is the percent increase if enrollment in a class was 57 in spring and 81 in the following fall? <var name="'42'" width="4" /></p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>The ratio is <m>\frac{81}{57} \approx 1.42</m>. Because 81 is greater than 57 this is a percent increase. The increase is 42%.</p>
            </solution>
        </webwork> -->
        <myopenmath problem="1437364" />
    </exercise>

    <example xml:id="example-percent-increase-or-decrease">
        <p>What is the percent increase or decrease if enrollment in a class was 78 in fall and 38 in the following spring? Round the percent to the nearest unit.</p>
        <p>Because 38 is less than 78 this is a decrease. Similar to the percent increase we can calculate the decrease first and then calculate the percent. <m>78-38=40</m>. Thus the percent decrease is <me>100 \cdot \frac{40}{78} \approx 0.51282051 \approx 51\%</me>.</p>
        <p>As with the percent increase we can also start by simply computing what percent the fall enrollment is with respect to the prior spring enrollment. The ratio is <m>100 \cdot \frac{38}{78} \approx 0.48717949 \approx 0.49</m>. Because the new enrollment <em>is</em> 49% of the previous enrollment the decrease is 100%-49%=51%.</p>
            <image source="images/percent_decrease" width="50%" />
    </example>

    <p>For percent increase problems it may seem fastest to calculate new/old-100% whereas for percent decrease problems it may seem most effective to calculate (new-old)/old. The methods perform the same calculation, so you may choose the one with which you make the correct calculation the most frequently.</p>

        <p>This year's sales increased 3% over last year's sales. If total sales this year were $576,211, how much were last year's sales?</p>
        <p>We can use the usual part/whole definition. It is important to place our information in the correct locations. We are given a percent increase, so we will want to calculate the percent. This is <m>100\%+3\%=103\% = 1.03</m>. The amount we are given (this year) is the part; we want to calculate the whole.

        <p>If we want to know what amount constituted the 3% increase of the previous year, we can now calculate that as the difference. $576,211<minus/>$559,428.16=$16,782.84. We can confirm it is 3% by dividing <m>\frac{\$16782.84}{\$559428.16} \approx 0.029999991</m> or 3% when rounded. Notice we needed to compare to the previous year's amount which was not given.</p>
