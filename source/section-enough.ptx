<p>When working with measurements, we care about the reasonableness of the results. This leads us to two concepts. </p>

<definition xml:id="definition-accuracy">
	<title>Accuracy</title>
	<statement><p>The <term>accuracy</term> of a measurement is how close the measurement is to the actual value.</p></statement>
</definition>

<p>Note, if we are measuring something, it is because we don't know the actual value. Thus we can't determine the exact value of many kinds of data. Instead we will settle for repeatability. If we get the same result often enough, we can convince ourselves that it is reasonably accurate.</p>

<definition xml:id="definition-precision">
	<title>Precision</title>
	<statement><p>The <term>precision</term> of a measurement is the size of the smallest unit in it.</p></statement>
</definition>

<p>Note we can have high precision with low accuracy. That is, just because we write a lot of decimal places does not mean they are close to the actual value.</p>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-enough-sigfigs">
	<title>Significant Figures</title>

<p>When writing down measurements we need a way to indicate how precise the measurement is. <term>Significant digits</term> also called <term>significant figures</term> or simply <q>sig figs</q> are a way to do this.</p>

<p>The rules for writing numbers with significant digits have two parts: non-zero digits, and zero digits.
	<ol>
		<li>All non-zero digits are signficant.</li>
		<li>Zeros between non-zeros are significant.</li>
		<li>Any zeros written to the right of the decimal point are significant.</li>
		<li>If zeros between non-zero digits (on left) and the decimal point (on right) are supposed to be significant, a line is drawn over top of the last significant digit.</li>
		<li>For numbers less than 1, zeros between the decimal point (on left) and non-zero digits (on right) are not significant.</li>
	</ol>
We can summarize these rules as: write only digits that you mean, and if it is ambiguous clarify.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-sigfigs">
		<title>Writing Significant Digits</title>

		<p>Each of these numbers is written with five (5) significant digits.
			<ul>
				<li><m>10267</m></li>
				<li><m>1.2400</m></li>
				<li><m>7201\bar{0}</m></li>
				<li><m>2834100</m></li>
				<li><m>0.0010527</m></li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</example>

	<p>We also need rules for arithmetic with significant digits. These are based on two principles
	<ul>
		<li>A result of arithmetic cannot be more precise than the least precise measurement.</li>
		<li>The number of significant digits cannot increase.</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p>For addition and subtraction the result (sum or difference) has the same precision as the least precise number added or subtracted. This means the result is not significant in any digit not significant in one of the numbers.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-sigfig-add">
		<title>Addition/Subtraction with Significant Digits</title>
		<p><m>723+11050=11770</m>. This is because the last significant digit of <m>11050</m> is the 10's position (with the 5 in it).</p>
		<p>An explanation of why this rule works is in this video.</p>
		<video youtube="kxnjKrjXOH4" xml:id="video-example-sigfig-add" />
	</example>

	<p>For multiplication and division the result (product or quotient) has the same number of significant digits as the least number of the input numbers.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-sigfig-multiply">
		<title>Multiplication/Division with Significant Digits</title>
		<p><m>11050/722=15.3</m>. This is because <m>722</m> has only 3 significant digits.</p>
		<p>An explanation of why this rule works is in this video.</p>

	<exercise xml:id="exercise-sigfigs1">
		<webwork>
			<statement>
				<p>How many significant digits does <m>203</m> have? <var name="'3'" width="3" /> </p>
				<p>How many significant digits does <m>20\bar{0}0</m> have? <var name="'3'" width="3" /> </p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>Because 203 ends with a non-zero digit all three digits are significant.</p>
				<p>Because the 0 in the tens position is marked as significant (the bar) there are 3 significant digits</p>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-rounding">
	<title>Rounding</title>

	<p>For a variety of reasons in applications we need to round a number, that is ignore some level of precision. For example if we need 21 eggs and eggs are sold in cartons of one dozen (12) eggs, we need <m>21/12=1.75</m> cartons. Since we cannot purchase part of a carton, we must round 1.75 to 2, and purchase 2 cartons.</p>
	<p>Note in this example reality requires us to round up to the nearest integer. We round to an integer because we cannot purchase fractional cartons of eggs. We had to round up, because rounding down would leave us with insufficient eggs (and we are hungry).</p>
	<p>Suppose you have a bank account containing $11410 that accrues 1.65% interest. The bank calculates the payment should be <m>\$11410 \cdot 0.00165 = \$18.8265</m>. The bank will pay you $18.82. They round to the nearest one hundredth because cents is a unit which can be paid. They round down, because they like paying less.</p>

	<p>We can round to the nearest thousand or the nearest hundredth. Context or instructions will specify which. We can round up, down, or simply <q>round</q>.</p>

		<task>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-greatest-error">
	<title>Greatest Possible Error</title>

	<p>When we write a number with significant digits notation or we round a number we write a number that has some error in it. For example if it rained 0.86 inches in a day and we write 0.9 inches, there is an error of 0.4. The important question is <q>how big can the error be?</q>.</p>

	<p>Because our rule for rounding is digits 0-4 round down round up and digits 5-9, rounding will always have a greatest possible error of 5. Consider <xref ref="example-greatest-error" />.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-greatest-error">
		<statement><p>What is the greatest possible error if 130 was rounded to the nearest 10?</p></statement>
		<solution>
			<p>One possibility is that 130 was rounded down. Then the original number was one of 130, 131, 132, 133, or 134. 134 is the farthest away from 130 at <m>134-130=4</m>.</p>
			<p>The other possibility is that 130 was rounded up. Then the original number was one of 125, 126, 127, 128, or 129. 125 is the farthest away at <m>130-125=5</m>.</p>
			<p>Thus the greatest possible error was 5 from the case that 125 was rounded up.</p>
			<p>Note in this solution we assumed the number rounded was an integer. However, if we allowed for 134.927 and 125.01 the result would be the same. the extra digits don't change the rounding.</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<example xml:id="example-greatest-error2">
		<statement><p>What is the greatest possible error if 9.31 was rounded to the nearest hundredth?</p></statement>
		<solution><p>The largest possible error is if 9.31 was rounded up from 9.305. Thus the greatest possible error is 5 one thousdandths.</p></solution>
	</example>

	<example xml:id="example-greatest-error-up">
		<statement><p>What is the greatest possible error if 223 was rounded up to the nearest one?</p></statement>
		<solution><p>223 could have been rounded up from 222.1. But it could also have been rounded up from 222.01 or anything else. Thus the greatest possible error is less than 1 (<m>223-222=1</m>).</p></solution>
	</example>

	<p>Notice we have to know what type of rounding was used. In most measurements (i.e., significant digits) standard rounding will be used. For example think about measuring on a ruler: if the object isn't exactly on one of the lines, you will choose the closest one. The closest one requires rounding.</p>

	<exercise xml:id="exercise-greatest-error1">
		<webwork>
			<statement>
				<p>What is the greatest possible error if 8120 was rounded to the nearest ten? <var name="'5'" width="3" /> </p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>This could be any number from 8115 to 8124. Thus the greatest possible error is 5.</p>
			</solution>
	    </webwork>
	</exercise>

	<exercise xml:id="exercise-greatest-error2">
		<webwork>
			<statement>
				<p>What is the greatest possible error if <m>934\bar{0}00</m>? <var name="'50'" width="3" /> </p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>The smallest accurate digit is the hundreds position as indicated by the bar. Thus the number could be anything from 933950-934049. Thus the greatest possible error is 50.</p>
