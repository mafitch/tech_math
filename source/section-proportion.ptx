<title>Proportions</title>

<introduction>

<p>Ratio problems presume that the ratio does not change. This makes sense in examples like conversion of units. For example 1 inch is always approximately 2.54 cm. In contrast rates often change: your average speed may be 25 mph, but you must have driven slower and faster during that drive. For ratios that do not change we can write equations and solve for properties.</p>

		<statement><p>For a particular cheesecake recipe there is <m>15\bar{0}</m> g of eggs and <m>150\bar{0}</m> g of cream cheese. We will determine how many grams of eggs we need if we triple the recipe. This means everything will be in ratio of 2/1. Note the 2 and 1 have infinite significant figures (they are exact numbers rather than approximated measurements).

			<statement>
				<p>For a particular cheesecake recipe there is <m>15\bar{0}</m> g of eggs and <m>150\bar{0}</m> g of cream cheese. Suppose you have <m>35\bar{0}</m> g of eggs and <m>340\bar{0}</m> g of cream cheese. How much of the egg and cream cheese can you use?</p>
				<p>Egg: <var name="'340'" width="4" /> </p>
				<p>Cream cheese: <var name="'3400'" width="5" /> </p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>The egg to cream cheese must be in a 1/10 ratio. We can check what the ratio of ingredients we have is. <me>\frac{35\bar{0} \text{ g}}{340\bar{0} \text{ g}} \approx 0.103</me> Because this is more than <m>1/10=0.1</m> we have more egg than we can use. Thus we will set up the 1/10 ratio using all of the cream cheese.

					<mrow>34\bar{0}.0 &amp; = E \text{ g}.</mrow>

				We can use 340 of the 350 grams of egg.</p>

	<p>Shapes other than triangles can be similar. For example there are similar rectangles and similar pentagons. To be similar they must have the same number of sides, corresponding angles must be the same, and corresponding sides must be in the same ratio. Note that just having the same angles is insufficient: any two rectangles have all the same angles (right angles) but not every pair is similar.</p>

	<aside>
		<title>Similar Polygons</title>
		<p>One way to define similar polygons that avoids the trap illustrated by rectangles is to require every triangle made from vertices to have the same angles. Take two, non-similar rectangles and find the triangles that don't match.</p>
	</aside>

	<p>One place where similar shapes (beyond triangles) is used is scale drawing and scale models. If you ever built a model of a car or a plane or some such there was most likely a scale given. For example they may be 1/32 scale. This means that one inch on the model is 32 inches on the actual object.</p>
