    <p>This section addresses the following topics.
        <ul>
            <li>Interpret data in various formats and analyze mathematical models</li>
            <li>Read and use mathematical models in a technical document</li>
        </ul>
        This section covers the following mathematical concepts.
        <ul>
            <li>Set up and solve proportions (skill)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>In some circumstances a ratio is fixed. For example when we scale a recipe the ratio of flour to water must remain the same. This means the original ratio (in recipe) must equal the ratio used (when doubling for example). These circumstances are called <term>proportions</term>. This section presents a variety of problems in which this is useful and, indirectly, reviews the algebra needed to solve them.</p>

    <p>Fixed ratios make sense in examples like conversion of units. For example 1 gallon is always 4 quarts. In contrast rates often change: your average speed may be 25 mph, but you must have driven slower and faster during that drive. For the ratios that do not change we can write equations and solve for properties.</p>

    <title>Proportion Examples</title>

    <p>Proportion problems start with a fixed ratio. Because it is fixed we can write the first ratio equals the second ratio. This gives us an equation to solve. There are multiple ways to solve these, each of which is demonstrated below.</p>

    <video youtube="gk2PpTQyZk8" xml:id="video-example-proportion-solve" />

    <p>The first example shows a straight forward proportion with the simplest solving method. This is like solving a percent problem.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-proportion-cheesecake-double">
        <title>Cheesecake Groceries: Double</title>
        <p>For a particular cheesecake recipe there is <m>15\bar{0}</m> g of eggs and <m>150\bar{0}</m> g of cream cheese. We will determine how many grams of eggs we need if we double the recipe. This means everything will be in ratio of 2/1.</p>
        <p>The proportion is based on the original recipe and the doubled recipe: that is every ingredient will be doubled. We must perform the calculation for eggs and cream cheese separately. We want the ratio of number of eggs in the doubled recipe to the number of eggs in the original recipe to be 2/1. Thus <me>\frac{2}{1} = \frac{E \text{ g}}{15\bar{0} \text{ g}}.</me> Because the quantity to solve is in the numerator we can simply multiply to isolate that quantity (variable).
        <md>
            <mrow>\frac{2}{1} &amp; = \frac{E \text{ g}}{15\bar{0} \text{ g}}.</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{2}{1} \cdot 150 \text{ g} &amp; = \frac{E \text{ g}}{15\bar{0} \text{ g}} \cdot 150 \text{ g}. \text{ Eliminating the denominator.}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{2}{1} \cdot 15\bar{0} \text{ g} &amp; = E</mrow>
            <mrow>30\bar{0} \text{ g} &amp; = E \text{ of eggs}.</mrow>
        </md></p>
        <p>Because we are using measurements in grams (mass/weight), we used significant figures for rounding. In commercial recipes (and quality home cooking) weights are used because items like eggs are not uniform in mass. If we always use 3 eggs, it might be more or less than we need which will mess up the food. Also note the 2 and 1 are exact numbers.</p>
    </example>

    <p>This example may seem overly simple because doubling is easy, but the arithmetic is the same for any scaling.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-proportion-non-integer-scale">
        <p>Guido needs 6 dozen cookies. A recipe makes 4 dozen. If that recipe calls for <m>30\overline{0}</m> g of flour, how much flour does he need for the 6 dozen cookies?</p>
        <p>First, we determine the ratio for scaling. We want 6 dozen and the recipe makes 4 dozen so our ratio is <m>6/4 = 3/2</m>. Thus to determine the amount of flour needed we setup the proportion
        <md>
            <mrow>\frac{3}{2} &amp; = \frac{F \text{ g}}{30\overline{0} \text{ g}}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{3}{2} \cdot 30\overline{0} \text{ g} &amp; = \frac{F \text{ g}}{30\overline{0} \text{ g}} 30\overline{0} \text{ g}</mrow>
            <mrow>45\overline{0} \text{ g} &amp; = F</mrow>
        </md></p>
    </example>

    <p>The following example shows methods for handling proportions when the desired quantity (variable) ends up in the denominator.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-proportion-cheesecake-scale">
        <title>Cheesecake Groceries: Unknown</title>
        <p>For a particular cheesecake recipe there is <m>15\bar{0}</m> g of eggs and <m>150\bar{0}</m> g of cream cheese. If we have <m>35\bar{0}</m> g of egg how much cream cheese do we need? We know that the egg to cream cheese ratio must be 150/1500. We notice <m>150/1500 = 1/10</m>. This means we need to solve <me>\frac{1}{10} = \frac{35\bar{0} \text{ g}}{C \text{ g}}.</me></p>
        <p>Because a ratio expresses the relationship between two quantities, it is not important which is numerator or denominator. Thus it is equally valid to write
        <md>
            <mrow>\frac{10}{1} &amp; = \frac{C \text{ g}}{35\bar{0} \text{ g}}.</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{10}{1} \cdot 350 \text{ g} &amp; = \frac{C \text{ g}}{350 \text{ g}} \cdot 350 \text{ g}.</mrow>

        </md></p>

    <p>The following example shows an alternate way to solve for the desired quantity when it is in the denominator.</p>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-proportion-complex">
    <title>Multiple Proportions</title>

    <p>When we experience math in the wild, problems do not come labeled with solving methods. We must recognize the math and apply our knowledge appropriately. The next example illustrates identifying ratios (proportions) more than once when answering a question.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-proportion-three-in-one">
        <p>Suppose a Diamond DA-20 climbs at the rate of <m>\frac{550 \text{ feet}}{1.0 \text{ minute}}</m> and is traveling <m>\frac{72.8 \text{ nm}}{\text{hour}}</m> across the ground during this climb. How far forward does the plane fly during a climb of 3500 feet?</p>
        <p>Because we are told how far the plane climbs, we must use the rate of climb ratio first. As before we can calculate how long it will take to climb. <me>3500 \text{ ft} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ min}}{550 \text{ ft}} = 6.4 \text{ min}</me>.</p>
        <p>Now that we know how long the plane flies during this climb, we can use that time with the ground speed ratio to calculate how far foward it flies. However, first we must convert the speed to feet per minute or the time to hours. We use conversions from <xref ref="table-customary-convert" />. <me>\frac{72.8 \text{ nm}}{\text{hr}} \cdot \frac{6076 \text{ ft}}{\text{nm}} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ hr}}{60 \text{ min}} \approx \frac{7370 \text{ ft}}{\text{min}}</me></p>
        <p>Finally we can use this rate and the time of climb to calculate the desired distance.
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{7370 \text{ ft}}{\text{min}} &amp; = \frac{s \text{ ft}}{6.4 \text{ min}}</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{7370 \text{ ft}}{\text{min}} \cdot (6.4 \text{ min}) &amp; = \frac{s \text{ ft}}{6.4 \text{ min}} \cdot (6.4 \text{ min})</mrow>
                <mrow>47000 \approx s \text{ ft}</mrow>
            </md>
        If desired, we can convert this to nautical miles which is <me>(47000 \text{ ft}) \cdot \frac{1 \text{nm}}{6076 \text{ ft}} = 7.8 \text{ nm}</me></p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-proportion-constraints">
        <p>A recipe for hush puppies calls for 150 g of flour for 340 g of buttermilk. If we have 465 g of flour and 918 g of buttermilk, how much of the flour and buttermilk can we use? Which one constrains us (limits size of our batch)? Note quality kitchen scales are accurate to a single gram.</p>
        <p>The ingredients must remain in the ratio <m>\frac{340 \text{ g buttermilk}}{150 \text{ g flour}} = \frac{34 \text{ g buttermilk}}{15 \text{ g flour}}</m>. We can select either ingredient and see how much the ratio tells us we need of the other ingredient.</p>
        <p>Suppose we use all 465 g of flour. Then we can setup the proportion
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{34 \text{ g buttermilk}}{15 \text{ g flour}} &amp; = \frac{B \text{ g}}{465 \text{ g flour}}</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{34 \text{ g buttermilk}}{15 \text{ g flour}} \cdot (465 \text{ g flour}) &amp; = \frac{B \text{ g}}{465 \text{ g flour}} \cdot (465 \text{ g flour})</mrow>
                <mrow>1054 \text{ g} &amp; = B.</mrow>
            </md>
        Notice that this is more buttermilk than we have. That means the buttermilk is the limiting ingredient. We will be able to use all of the buttermilk, but only some of the flour. To determine how much we setup the proportion but this time solve for flour.</p>
        <p>We will use all 918 g of buttermilk. Then we can setup the proportion
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{15 \text{ g flour}}{34 \text{ g buttermilk}} &amp; = \frac{F \text{ g}}{918 \text{ g buttermilk}}</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{15 \text{ g flour}}{34 \text{ g buttermilk}} \cdot (918 \text{ g buttermilk}) &amp; = \frac{F \text{ g}}{918 \text{ g buttermilk}} \cdot (918 \text{ g buttermilk})</mrow>
                <mrow>405 \text{ g} &amp; = F.</mrow>
            </md>
        Thus we can use all 918 g of buttermilk and 405 of the 465 g of flour. Note we have rounded everything to one gram because that is as accurate as we can measure with our scale. If a single recipe uses 340 g of buttermilk, then we will be making <me>\frac{918 \text{ g}}{340 \text{ g}} = 2.7</me> times as much.</p>

            <solution>
                <p>First we can figure out whether the egg or the cream cheese is the limiting ingredient.

We can calculate the ratio of ingredients we have <me>\frac{35\bar{0} \text{ g}}{340\bar{0} \text{ g}} \approx 0.103</me> Because this is more than <m>0.103 \gt 0.1=1/10,</m> we have more egg than we can use, because the numerator (egg) is bigger.

    <introduction>
        <p>This section presents a geometric fact which is expressed as proportions. This geometry can be used to solve for distances or lengths in some circumstances. First we define and illustrate the geometric fact.</p>
    </introduction>

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsection-similar-triangle-defined">
        <title>Explaining Similar Triangles</title>

        <definition xml:id="definition-similar-triangles">
            <title>Similar Triangles</title>
            <statement><p>Two triangles are <term>similar</term> if and only if corresponding angles are the same.</p></statement>
        </definition>

        <p>When triangles are similiar their corresponding side lengths are proportional. Two sides from the different triangles are <term>corresponding</term> if they are across from angles of the same measurement. This is illustrated in the following example.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-illustrate-similar-triangles">
            <image source="images/similar_triangles" />
            <p>The triangles <m>\triangle ABC</m> and <m>\triangle DEF</m> are similar. Notice that the angles at <m>A</m> and <m>D</m> have the same measure (64<degree/>). The same is true of the angles at <m>B</m> and <m>E</m> (both 80<degree/>) and the angles at <m>C</m> and <m>F</m> (both 36<degree/>).</p>
            <p> <m>BC</m> is the side opposite the angle at <m>A</m> and <m>EF</m> is the side opposite the angle at <m>D</m>. Because <m>A</m> and <m>D</m> have the same measure, the sides opposite them are corresponding sides.</p>
            <p>Similarly <m>CA</m> is the side opposite the angle at <m>B</m> and <m>FD</m> is the side opposite the angle at <m>E</m>. Because <m>B</m> and <m>E</m> have the same measure, the sides opposite them are corresponding sides.</p>
            <p>What is the third pair of corresponding sides?</p>
            <p>As a result the following ratios of sides are the same <me>\frac{AB}{DE}=\frac{BC}{EF}=\frac{CA}{FD}.</me> You can confirm this by dividing the lengths (<m>\frac{3.26}{2.51}=\frac{4.86}{3.73}=\frac{5.34}{4.1}</m>).</p>
        </example>

        <p>From a single example we might think this was just a special case. To convince yourself use the following interactive example.</p>

                    <p>Move one of the corners of the bottom triangle around which will change the size of that triangle. As you do, notice that the side lengths change, but the two ratios of side lengths remain the same. Every ratio of corresponding sides would be the same.</p>
                    <p>Repeat the experiment by moving one of the corners of the top triangle. This will change the shape of both triangles (they will remain similar). Note that the ratios remain the same.</p>

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsection-similarity-proportion">
        <title>Calculating Using Similar Triangles</title>

        <p>We can use the proportionaliy of similar triangle sides lengths to calculate the lengths using the same technique as <xref ref="example-ratio-airspeed-solve" />.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-similar-triangles">
            <image source="images/similar_triangles_369" />
            <p>Suppose triangle ABC has angles <m>90^\circ, 60^\circ, 30^\circ</m> with the lengths of the sides opposite them <m>2.000, 1.732, 1.000</m>. If triangle DEF also has angles <m>90^\circ, 60^\circ, 30^\circ</m> it is similar. Suppose the length of the side <m>DE</m> opposite the <m>30^\circ</m> angle at point F is <m>2.000</m>.</p>
            <p>First, we identify the corresponding sides. <m>\overline{AB}</m> and <m>\overline{DE}</m> are opposite <m>30^\circ</m> angles so they are corresponding. <m>\overline{CA}</m> and <m>\overline{FD}</m> are opposite <m>60^\circ</m> angles so they are corresponding. Finally, <m>\overline{BC}</m> and <m>\overline{EF}</m> are opposite <m>90^\circ</m> angles so they are corresponding. This means <me>\frac{\overline{AB}}{\overline{DE}} = \frac{\overline{CA}}{\overline{FD}} = \frac{\overline{BC}}{\overline{EF}}.</me></p>

        <title>Similarity in Applications</title>

        <p>Similar triangles can be found in a variety of circumstances. This example recognizes similar triangles in a context which has been used many time in history for indirect measurement.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-similar-measure-height">
            <image source="images/shadow_light_pole" />
            <p>A person is standing 30 ft from a light pole. The shadow cast by the light is 8 ft long. If the person is 5 ft 6 in tall, how high is the point on the light that is casting the shadow?</p>
            <p>In this image we have two (right) triangles that will be useful. The smaller one has legs of length 8 ft and 5 ft 6 in. The third side (hypotenuse) is the dashed gray line, but we will not need it. The other triangle has a leg that is the entire bottom (length 8 ft plus 30 ft). The other leg is the height of the light. The angles of the two triangles are the same. Because they are both right triangles (we are supposing the light post is straight up and the person is standing straight up), the angles at the persons feet and the base of the light are the same. They share the angle on the left (between dashed line and ground). The third angle must match because the first two do.</p>
            <p>Because these have the same angles, they are similar, and we can use the proportionality of corresponding side lengths. Before we do, we will convert the height of the person to decimal. 5 ft 6 in is 5.5 ft.
                <md>
                    <mrow>\frac{5.5 \text{ ft}}{8 \text{ ft}} \amp = \frac{h}{38 \text{ ft}}.</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{5.5 \text{ ft}}{8 \text{ ft}} \cdot (38 \text{ ft}) \amp = \frac{h}{38 \text{ ft}} \cdot (38 \text{ ft}).</mrow>
                    <mrow>26.125 \text{ ft} \amp = h.</mrow>
                </md>
            If these measurements were taken with a tape measure we can reasonably suppose they are accurate to the nearest inch. We can convert the 0.125 ft into inches. <me> 0.125 \text{ ft} \cdot \frac{12 \text{ in}}{1 \text{ ft}} = 1.5 \text{ in}.</me> Thus the height to that point on the light is 26 ft and 2 in.</p>
            <p>Note we use this type of measurement because it is simpler. We can measure across the ground much more easily than we can climb the pole and measure its height. It was not important that the person chose to be 30 ft from the pole. If they chose to be 20 ft, then the shadow would also be shorter (proportional). If we are too close it will be hard to accurately measure the short shadow (ever try to measure a shadow?).</p>
        </example>

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsection-extending-similarity">
        <title>Similarity Beyond Triangles</title>

        <p>Shapes other than triangles can be similar. For example there are similar rectangles and similar pentagons. To be similar they must have the same number of sides, corresponding angles must be the same, and corresponding sides must be in the same ratio. Note that just having the same angles is insufficient: any two rectangles have all the same angles (right angles) but not every pair is similar.</p>

        <aside>
            <title>Similar Polygons</title>
            <p>One way to define similar polygons that avoids the trap illustrated by rectangles is to break the shape down into triangles (e.g., a rectangle can be split into two triangles). Then we require that every such triangle has the same angles. Note how we break a shape down into triangles is not unique. Take two, non-similar rectangles and find the triangles that don't match.</p>
        </aside>

        <p>One place where similar shapes (beyond triangles) is used is scale drawing and scale models. If you ever built a model of a car or a plane or some such there was most likely a scale given. For example they may be 1/32 scale. This means that one inch on the model is 32 inches on the actual object.</p>
