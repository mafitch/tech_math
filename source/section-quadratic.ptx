<title>Quadratics</title>

<introduction>

    <p>This section addresses the following topics.
        <ul>
            <li>Interpret data in various formats and analyze mathematical models</li>
            <li>Read and use mathematical models in a technical document</li>
        </ul>
        This section covers the following mathematical concepts.
        <ul>
            <li>Identify rates as linear, quadratic, exponential, or other (critical thinking)</li>
            <li>Read and interpret models (critical thinking)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>In <xref ref="section-variation" /> we learned to identify data that has a quadratic relation. This section presents algebraic notation for quadratics with emphasis on the forms we will use in this book. You should be able to identify a model as quadratic by looking at the equation.</p>

    <p>One of comparing different rates is to enable us to enable us to provide more specific statements than <q>slow</q> or <q>fast.</q> Quadratic is faster than linear. In the next chapter we will learn that exponential is faster than quadratic (or any polynomial). Frequently descriptions of rates in casual conversation and also in the media are lacking in detail or are even inaccurate. This is part of the concept <q>Identify rates as linear, quadratic, exponential, or other.</q></p>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-quadratic-forms">
    <title>Algebraic Forms of Quadratics</title>

    <p><term>Quadratic</term> refers to any expression or equation that has a non-zero squared term. The three most common forms are below. All three rows have the same quadratic.</p>

    <table xml:id="table-quadratic-notation">
        <title>Algebraic Notation for Quadratics</title>
        <tabular>
            <row><cell>Example</cell> <cell>Form</cell> <cell>Description</cell> </row>
            <row><cell><m>y=5x^2-17x-12</m></cell> <cell><m>y=ax^2+bx+c</m>, <m>a \ne 0</m></cell> <cell>Standard</cell> </row>

    <p>For this class the form we will see the most is <me>y=k x^2</me> where <m>k</m> has some meaning in each model.</p>

    <p>When reading models quadratics may look a little different. <xref ref="table-quadratic-appearance" /> shows examples of equations that are quadratic and some that are not (but might look like it).</p>

    <title>Quadratic Models</title>

    <p>Now that we know how to recognize models (equations) as quadratic, we will present a few.</p>

    <fact xml:id="model-load-factor">
        <title>Load Factor</title>
        <statement>
            <p>The maximum load factor on an aircraft is <me>n_{max}=\left(\frac{v}{v_s}\right)^2</me> where
            <ul>
                <li><m>n</m> is the load factor,</li>
                <li><m>v</m> is the velocity, and</li>
                <li><m>v_s</m> is the stall speed.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>Load factor is a measure of the force exerted on the aircraft by a maneuver. Maximum load factor is the greatest load factor an aircraft would experience if at the given speed, the aircraft executed a maximum performance maneuver.</p>
            <p>Load factor is measured as a multiple of the force of gravity. Thus a load factor of 2 means the object is subject to a force twice as strong as earth's gravity. The expression <q>pulling g's</q> refers to experiencing a load factor greater than one.</p>

        <title>Kinetic Energy</title>
        <statement>
            <p>The kinetic energy of an object in motion, we will consider flight of gliders, is <me>E = \frac{1}{2}m v^2</me> where
            <ul>
                <li><m>m</m> is the mass (think weight) of the object</li>

    <title>Inversely Quadratic Relations</title>

    <p><xref ref="table-quadratic-appearance" /> has <m>y=17/x^2</m> as an example that is not quadratic. Instead <m>y</m> varies inversely with the square of <m>x</m>. While not quadratic, as illustrated below by the tables of differences, they can be solved using the same techniques. Solving quadratics will be demonstrated in the next section.</p>

    <p>In <xref ref="table-square-is-quadratic" /> the second differences are all 6, so that is quadratic. In contrast in <xref ref="table-inverse-square-is-not-quadratic" /> the second differences are all different.</p>
