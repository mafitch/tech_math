    <p>Having looked at models in general this section presents linear models. First, we look at some examples and learn how the pieces of a linear model work. Next, we learn to write linear models given a description of a problem.

    <title>Linear Models</title>

    <p>This section presents examples of linear models and provides an explanation for the two parts of a linear model.</p>

    <p>A linear model (equation) can be written in the following, equivalent forms.
        <ul>
            <li><m>y = mx+c = \frac{a}{b}x+c</m></li>
            <li><m>ay+bx+c = 0</m></li>
        </ul>
    The second form can be solved for y which will make it look like the first form.

        <title>Model of Temperature Change with Altitude</title>

        <p>As a result of atmospheric physics temperature decreases as the distance above the ground increases. For lower altitudes this can be modeled as <me>T_A = T_G - \left(\frac{3.5}{1000}\right)A.</me>
        <ul>
            <li><m>T_A</m> is the expected temperature at the specified altitude.</li>
            <li><m>T_G</m> is the temperature at ground level.</li>
            <li><m>A</m> is the specified altitude in number of feet above ground level.</li>
            <li><m>\frac{3.5^\circ}{1000 \text{ ft}}</m> is the rate of temperature decrease.</li>
        </ul>
        All temperatures are in Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p>Before we can use this model we need to know the parameter <m>T_G</m>. A parameter is not a variable, rather it is a value (number) that we obtain from the circumstances and write into the model (equation) before we do any work.</p>
        <p>In contrast the ratio <m>-\frac{3.5^\circ}{1000 \text{ ft}}</m> is a constant (not a parameter), because it is a result of atmospheric physics that is not dependent on the location for this simplified model.</p>
        <p>Temperature (<m>T_A</m>) and altitude (<m>A</m>) are variables which implies that the model shows a relationship between these two properties.</p>
        <p>The model subtracts from the starting temperature results in a decrease of temperature from <m>T_G</m>. This implies that temperature decreases with altitude.</p>
        <p>Every linear model (equation) has a rate. In this case <m>m=\frac{a}{b}=-\frac{3.5}{1000}</m>.</p>
        <p>Every linear model has a shift, which may be zero. In this case <m>c=T_G</m>.</p>

        <p>A fixed wing aircraft flown optimally climbs from a starting altitude at a fixed climb rate. <me>A_t = A_G+C \cdot t.</me>

A parameter is not a variable, rather it is a value (number) that we obtain from the circumstances and write into the model (equation) before we do any work. <m>A_G</m> varies by airport, because they are at different altitudes. The rate <m>C</m> must be obtained for each plane and is often available in the aircraft's Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).</p>

            <p>These calculations are made as part of safety planning. The data is sufficiently accurate that rounding is not necessary. Rather we make conservative estimates of the parameters, so that there is always a safety buffer. In this case a conservative estimate for <m>A_G</m> is to round down: this will give us a lower altitude. If that lower altitude is safe, then one 5 feet higher will be safe as well. For the climb rate a conservative estimate is to round down as well. If we can reach an altitude at 700 ft/min, then we will reach it a little earlier at 720 ft/min.</p>

        <title>Model of Fuel Remaining Calculation</title>

        <p>When operated at a fixed power setting a vehicle burns the same amount of gas per hour (or other time unit). This leads to the linear model <me>F_t = F_I - r \cdot t.</me>

        Fuel amounts will be measured in units of volume like gallons or liters. Time will be measured in minutes or hours. The rate <m>r</m> is then in units such as gallons/hour or liters/min.</p>

        <p>Final fuel (<m>F_t</m>) and time (<m>t</m>) are the variables which implies that the model shows a relationship between time flown and fuel available (left in the tanks).</p>

    <title>Building Linear Models</title>

    <p>The previous section presented linear models, and illustrated using provided models. This section presents problems that can be modeled as linear equations, and illustrates writing the model (equation) before using it.</p>

    <p>A linear model has a starting point (shift, <m>b</m>) and rate (ratio, <m>m</m>). We need to identify these and then write the linear model <me>y = mx+b</me> with these values. We should also label units and explain any parameters.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-linear-model-purchase">
        <p>Consider rope that costs $0.93 per foot with a shipping charge of $7.64. To produce a model for the cost of each purchase we will start by trying a couple specific orders.</p>
        <p>Suppose we are purchasing 20 feet of this rope. The cost for the 20 feet will be <m>20 \text{ ft} \cdot \frac{\$0.93}{\text{ft}}</m>, because each foot is $0.93. This is just like unit conversion: the units ($/ft and ft) suggest multiplying.</p>
        <p>Notice this multiplication is also the same as using a ratio (proportion). We could setup <m>\frac{\$0.93}{1 \text{ft}} = \frac{C}{20 \text{ ft}}</m> When we solve this we end up with the same multiplication <m>20 \text{ ft} \cdot \frac{\$0.93}{\text{ft}}</m>.</p>
        <p>Next we must add the shipping charge. Thus the final cost is <m>20 \text{ ft} \cdot \frac{\$0.93}{\text{ft}}+\$7.64 = \$26.24</m>. Note there is no rounding because all numbers are exact (no measurements, so no signficant digits) and no fractions of a cent occurred.</p>
        <p>Suppose we are purchasing 100 feet of this rope. The cost for the 100 feet will be <me>100 \text{ ft} \cdot \frac{\$0.93}{\text{ft}}</me>. Then we must add the shipping charge. Thus the final cost is <m>100 \text{ ft} \cdot \frac{\$0.93}{\text{ft}}+\$7.64 = \$100.64</m>.</p>
        <p>Notice we could do this with any number of feet (unless the shipping charge increases for larger orders). So in general we can write the cost as <me>s \text{ ft} \cdot \frac{\$0.93}{\text{ft}}+\$7.64 = C</me>.</p>
        <p>Notice that this equation has a ratio (0.93/1), which is the cost per foot, but also has a shift (+7.64), which is the fixed shipping cost. Thus this is another linear equation.</p>
    </example>

    <p>When cost is set per linear foot, or per square yard, or similar per unit pricing we often end up with a linear model.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-linear-model-pressure-drop">
        <p>At lower altitudes the barometric pressure typically drops 1 inHg for every 1000 feet of elevation gained (the air is less dense higher up). To produce a model for pressure decrease we will start by calculating the pressure for a couple specific cases.</p>
        <p>If the pressure on the ground is 29.76 inHg, what do we expect the pressure to be flying at 4500 ft above ground level?</p>
        <p>The pressure drop is a ratio <m>\frac{1 \text{ inHg}}{1000 \text{ ft}}</m>. The units suggest we can multiply <m>4500 \text{ ft} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ inHg}}{1000 \text{ ft}} = 4.5 \text{ inHg}</m>. This is the drop in pressure. To calculate the resulting pressure we need <m>29.76 \text{ inHg} - 4.5^\circ \text{ inHg} = 25.26 \text{ inHg}</m>. We retain 2 decimal places because that is the traditional amount for reporting by meteorologists. Written as one calculation this is <m>T = 29.76-\left(4500 \text{ ft} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ inHg}}{1000 \text{ ft}}\right). </m></p>
        <p>If the pressure on the ground is 30.02 inHg what do we expect the pressure to be flying at 6000 ft above ground level?</p>
        <p>The pressure drop is a ratio <m>\frac{1 \text{ inHg}}{1000 \text{ ft}}</m>. The units suggest we can multiply <m>6000 \text{ ft} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ inHg}}{1000 \text{ ft}} = 6 \text{ inHg}</m>. This is the drop in pressure. To calculate the resulting pressure we need <m>30.02 \text{ inHg} - 6 \text{ inHg} = 24.02 \text{ inHg}</m>. Written as one calculation this is <m>P = 30.02-\left(6000 \text{ ft} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ inHg}}{1000 \text{ ft}}\right). </m></p>
        <p>Notice we could do this same calculation for any altitude. So in general we can write <me>P_A = P_G-\left(A \text{ ft} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ inHg}}{1000 \text{ ft}}\right). </me> <m>P_A</m> is the pressure at the specified altitude. <m>P_G</m> is the pressure at ground level. <m>A</m> is the altitude above ground level. This is a linear equation with a ratio of (-1/1000) which is the drop in pressure with altitude, and a shift of <m>P_G</m>, which is the pressure on the ground.</p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-linear-model-temperature-conversion">
        <p>We will find a model (equation) that converts temperature in Fahrenheit to temperature in Celsius. Note that every 9 degrees F is only 5 degrees C, so to convert we must scale the degrees. Also they use different values for the starting point (which is the freezing point of water). Fahrenheit starts at 32<degree/> and Celsius starts at 0<degree/>. Notice we have a ratio and a shift, so this already looks like a linear model.</p>
        <p>To begin with we will convert 52<degree/> F to Celsius. We will round to units, because this is just an example (no one will be injured in the demonstration of this model).</p>
        <p>The first step is to determine how many degrees above freezing. Because 32<degree/> F is the freezing temperature of water, 52<degree/> F is <m>52^\circ-32^\circ=20^\circ</m> above freezing.</p>
        <p>The next step is to scale the degrees. The conversion ratio is <m>\frac{9^\circ \text{ F}}{5^\circ \text{ C}}</m>. Converting the 20<degree/> above freezing is now a unit conversion. The units suggest we can multiply <m>20^\circ \text{ F} \cdot \frac{5^\circ \text{ C}}{9^\circ \text{ F}} \approx 11^\circ \text{ C}</m>. Notice we flipped the conversion ratio so the Fahrenheit degrees would divide to one. The result is 11<degree/> C above the freezing point of water in Celsius.</p>
        <p>Finally we can add the degrees Celsius to the starting point (freezing temperature of water). Because that is 0<degree/>, we have <m>0^\circ+11^\circ=11^\circ</m> C.</p>
        <p>If we write all of that as one step we obtain <me>(52^\circ \text{ F}-32^\circ \text{ F})\frac{5^\circ \text{ C}}{9^\circ \text{ F}}+0^\circ \text{ C} = 11^\circ \text{ C}</me>.</p>
        <p>Notice we could do this with any temperature. So if we call the temperature to convert <m>T</m> we have <me>C = (T-32)\frac{5}{9}+0</me>. This may not look like a starting point plus a ratio scaled. If we expand the expression we obtain <me>C = (T-32)\frac{5}{9}+0 = \frac{5}{9}T-\frac{160}{9}.</me> So this is a linear model. We prefer the first form of the equation because the numbers have meaning (e.g., 32<degree/> is the freezing point of water as opposed to <m>160/9</m> which has no useful meaning.</p>
    </example>

    <p>The temperature conversion example illustrates an idea about models. We describe a linear model as having a ratio and a (that is one) shift. However, in the temperature conversion example there is a shift a ratio and another shift, or two shifts. We showed these can be combined as one shift. That is always true. However, sometimes the version with multiple shifts is easier to understand. This will be true when we look at graphs of quadratics and exponentials (other forms of models).</p>

    <p>Some linear equations need one more technique. What would you need to solve <m>17-4y = 14-y</m>? Below is an example of solving a similar linear equation.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-solve-linear-combine">
        <statement><p>Solve <m>17-4y = 5+2y</m>.</p></statement>
        <solution><p><md>

    <p>Another linear equation is <m>\frac{x}{3}+\frac{x}{4}=\frac{7}{12}</m>. How would you solve it?</p>
    <p>We can solve this the same as in <xref ref="example-solve-linear-combine"  /> but there is another technique as well whic is shown below.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-solve-linear-clear">

            This is referred to as clearing denominators. We are once again eliminating division by multiplying. Always remember to distribute. Note, we could multiply once if we figured out the correct number (it would be 35 in this case), but there are no prizes for doing this fast, so you can do this either way.</p></solution>
    </example>

    <p>Now that we have practiced solving linear equations, we can use this skill with the models.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-solve-temperature-drop">
        <p>Given the temperature model in <xref ref="model-temperature-altitude-fahrenheit" text="title" /> and supposing the temperature at ground level is 65, determine at what altitude we expect the temperature to be freezing.</p>
        <p>In this case the model is <m>T_A = 65^\circ-\frac{3.5^\circ}{1000 \text{ ft}}A</m>. We know <m>T_A=32^\circ</m> and we want to calculate <m>A</m>, the altitude in feet.
        <md>
            <mrow>32^\circ &amp; = 65^\circ-\frac{3.5^\circ}{1000 \text{ ft}}A</mrow>
            <mrow>-65^\circ + 32^\circ &amp; = -65^\circ + 65^\circ-\frac{3.5^\circ}{1000 \text{ ft}}A</mrow>
            <mrow>-33^\circ &amp; = -\frac{3.5^\circ}{1000 \text{ ft}}A</mrow>
            <mrow>-\frac{1000 \text{ ft}}{3.5^\circ} \cdot -33^\circ &amp; = -\frac{1000 \text{ ft}}{3.5^\circ} \cdot -\frac{3.5^\circ}{1000 \text{ ft}}A</mrow>
            <mrow>9428.571428 \text{ ft} &amp; = A.</mrow>
            <mrow>9430 \text{ ft} &amp; \approx A.</mrow>
        </md>
        We round to the tens position because that is the precision shown by many altimeters.</p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-solve-time-altitude">
        <p>Given the time to altitude model in <xref ref="model-time-to-altitude" text="title" /> and supposing that we are climbing from 80 ft MSL to 5000 ft MSL with a climb rate of 700 ft/min, how long will it take to complete the climb?</p>
        <p>In this case the model is <m>A_t = 80 \text{ ft} + \frac{700 \text{ ft}}{\text{min}}t</m>. We know <m>A_t=5000</m> ft, and we want to know the time <m>t</m>.

            <mrow>8 &amp; = t.</mrow>
        </md>
        We round up as a safety margin: it is better to assume we need 8 minutes and be higher than to hope we can recognize 0.03 of a minute (not quite 2 seconds).</p>
