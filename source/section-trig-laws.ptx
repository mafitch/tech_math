<title>Non-Right Triangles</title>

<introduction>

    <p>This section addresses the following topics.
        <ul>
            <li>Read and use mathematical models in a technical document</li>
            <li>Communicate results in mathematical notation and in language appropriate to the technical field</li>
        </ul>
        This section covers the following mathematical concepts.
        <ul>
            <li>Use models including linear, quadratic, exponential/logarithmic, and trigonometric (skill)</li>
            <li>Analyze non-right triangles (skill)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>In <xref ref="section-trig-functions" /> we learned about relationships between angles of the triangles and their sides. However, most of our work was restricted to right triangles. This section demonstrates how to make similar calculations on non-right triangles.</p>

    <p>The one relationship that did not require a right angle is the <xref ref="theorem-triangle-angle-sum" text="title" /> Theorem.</p>

    <title>Law of Sines</title>

    <p>In <xref ref="section-trig-functions" /> we saw that there was a relationship between angles of a triangle and the side ratios. More generally there is a relationship between the magnitude of an angle of a triangle and the length of the side opposite it. The following theorem expresses this relationship.</p>

    <theorem xml:id="theorem-law-sines">
        <title>Law of Sines</title>
        <p>For a triangle with angles and sides as labeled in <xref ref="figure-triangle-labeled" />, <me> \frac{\sin A}{a} = \frac{\sin B}{b} = \frac{\sin C}{c}.</me> </p>

        <task>
            <p>What is the length of the side opposite the <m>45^\circ</m> angle?</p>
            <p>Because we know two angles and a side opposite one of them we can use the law of sines.

    <title>Ambiguous Triangles</title>

    <p>Above we calculated angles and side lengths given partial information about a triangle (two angles and a side). This section presents a case (two sides and an angle) that we cannot resolve without additional information.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-angle-side-side">
        <p>A triangle has an angle of measure <m>45^\circ</m> and the side opposite it is length 4. Another side is length 5. What are the other angles and side lengths?</p>
        <p>We can try to use the law of sines.
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{\sin(45^\circ)}{4} \amp = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{5}.</mrow>
                <mrow>5 \cdot \frac{\sin(45^\circ)}{4} \amp = \sin(\theta).</mrow>
                <mrow>\arcsin\left( \frac{5}{4}\sin(45^\circ) \right) \amp = \theta.</mrow>
                <mrow>62.11^\circ \amp \approx \theta.</mrow>
            </md>
        Using the angle sum fact we learn the other angle is <m>45^\circ+62.11^\circ+\alpha = 180^\circ</m> or <m>\alpha \approx 72.89^\circ</m>. We use the law of sines again to find the length of the final side.
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{\sin(45^\circ)}{4} \amp = \frac{\sin(72.89^\circ)}{c}.</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{4}{\sin(45^\circ)} \amp = \frac{c}{\sin(72.89^\circ)}.</mrow>
                <mrow>c \amp = 4 \frac{\sin(72.89^\circ)}{\sin(45^\circ)}.</mrow>
                <mrow>c \amp \approx 5.41.</mrow>
            </md>
        This gives us a triangle with angles: 45<degree/>, 62.11<degree/>, and 72.89<degree/>; and with side lengths: 4, 5, and 5.41.</p>
        <p>However, <m>\sin(117.89^\circ)=\sin(62.11^\circ)</m>, that is, <m>\arcsin\arcsin\left( \frac{5}{4}\sin(45^\circ) \right)</m> had multiple possible angles. We will repeat the calulcations above using <m>117.89^\circ</m> as the second angle. The third angle is <m>45^\circ+117.89^\circ+\alpha = 180^\circ</m> or <m>\alpha \approx 17.11^\circ</m>.
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{\sin(45^\circ)}{4} \amp = \frac{\sin(17.11^\circ)}{c}.</mrow>
                <mrow>c \sin(45^\circ) \amp = 4\sin(17.11^\circ).</mrow>
                <mrow>c \amp = 4 \frac{\sin(17.11^\circ)}{\sin(45^\circ)}.</mrow>
                <mrow>c \amp \approx 1.66.</mrow>
            </md></p>
        <p>Notice we have two, distinct triangles that match the initial angle and side information. They can be seen in <xref ref="figure-ass-two-cases" />. This indicates an ambiguity if what we know is this particular information.</p>
        <p>If you recall previous geometry this was the case Side-Side-Angle which does not prove congruent triangles.</p>
    </example>

    <p>When using the law of sines we will need to restrict ourselves to the two cases for which it works: Angle-Angle-Side and Angle-Side-Angle.</p>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-law-cosines">
    <title>Law of Cosines</title>

    <p>For right triangles we know the Pythagorean theorem is a relationship between the sides of those triangles. For triangles without a right angle that relationship must be slightly modified. The more general statement is below.</p>

    <theorem xml:id="theorem-law-cosines">
        <title>Law of Cosines</title>

        With an angle, we could now use the Law of Sines, but for practice we will use the Law of Cosines again.

        Knowing two of the angles we can use the angle sum fact to calculate the third angle measure. <m>40.0^\circ+60^\circ+C=180^\circ</m> so <m>C = 80.00^\circ</m>.</p>
        <p>If you recall previous geometry this was known as Side-Side-Side.</p>

        <p>Because we have two sides (<m>a,b</m>) and the angle between them (<m>C</m>) we can use the Law of Cosines.

            Now that we know a side and the angle opposite it, we can use the Law of Sines to find the remaining two angles.

    <title>Using Trigonometric Laws in Applications</title>

    <p>When we encounter non-right triangles in applications, we will need to check if we have the information needed to use the Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-flight-distance">
        <p>A sailboat sails 3341 ft at heading 300<degree/> then turns to heading 245<degree/> and sails 4051 ft. How far is the sailbot from the start of this maneuver?</p>
        <p>First, it helps to sketch an image.</p>
        <image source="images/sailboat-course" width="40%" />
        <p>In our sketch we see a non-right triangle. We know the lengths of two sides and can calculate the angle between them. This is side-angle-side which allows us to use the Law of Cosines to calculate the desired distance (length of dashed segment).</p>
        <p>We are given the headings for two segments but not an angle. The angle at the top is the change in headings. If we were at 300<degree/> and ended up at 245<degree/> then we turned left <m>300^\circ-245^\circ = 55^\circ</m>.</p>
        <p>Now we can apply the Law of Cosines.
            <md>
                <mrow>c^2 &amp; = 3341^2+4051^2-2(3341)(4051)\cos(55^\circ)</mrow>
                <mrow> &amp; = 27572882 - 27068782\cos(55^\circ)</mrow>
                <mrow> &amp; \approx 27572882 - 15526015.51</mrow>
                <mrow> &amp; \approx 12046866.49.</mrow>
                <mrow>c &amp; \approx \sqrt{12046866.49}</mrow>

                <mrow> &amp; \approx 3471.</mrow>

        Thus the sailboat ended up 3471 ft from its starting point.</p>

        <p>Two observers who are 2.3 miles apart on the ground at the same altitude record the angle at which they saw a passing aircraft at the same time. The observer at point A recorded an angle of 8.00<degree/> from horizontal. The observer at point B recorded an angle of 34.20<degree/> from horizontal. How high above ground was the aircraft?</p>
        <p>First, it helps to sketch an image.</p>
        <image source="images/aircraft-height" width="75%" />
        <p>How do we know that the larger angle is closer to the aircraft? If we think about an aircraft flying toward us, we realize that our head tips up (bigger angle) as it becomes closer. Thus the closer observer will have the larger angle.</p>
        <p>In our sketch we see multiple triangles including some right triangles. We want to calculate the height of the aircraft above ground which is part of the small, right triangle on the right of the diagram. Initially we know only the bottom angles (34.20<degree/> and the right angle) and none of the lengths. If we can calculate the length of the side on the left, then we could use the angles and that side length with the Law of Sines to calculate the height.</p>
        <p>That left side is also part of a non-right triangle with vertices at points A, B, and the aircraft. The side from A to B has length 2.9 mi, and we know the angles on either side. Because we have angle-side-angle information, we can apply the Law of Sines to calculate the length of the hypotenuse we need. In particular <me>\frac{\sin(P)}{2.3}=\frac{\sin(8.00^\circ)}{c}</me></p>
        <p>To calculate the angle at the plane (labeled <m>P</m> above) we will need to use the Triangle Angle Sum theorem. However, the angle we are given is the other side of the non-right triangle. The angle we need now is on the other side of that line, so its measure is <m>180^\circ-34.20^\circ = 145.80^\circ = B</m>. Now, b <m>8.00^\circ+145.80^\circ+P = 180^\circ</m> So, the angle at the aircraft is <m>P = 26.2^\circ</m>.</p>
        <p>Now we can apply the Law of Sines.
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{\sin(8.00^\circ)}{c} &amp; = \frac{\sin(26.2^\circ)}{2.3 \text{ mi}}.</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{c}{\sin(8.00^\circ)} &amp; = \frac{2.3 \text{ mi}}{\sin(26.2^\circ)}.</mrow>
                <mrow>c &amp; = \frac{(2.3 \text{ mi})\sin(8.00^\circ)}{\sin(26.2^\circ)}</mrow>
                <mrow> &amp; \approx 0.72501447</mrow>
                <mrow> &amp; \approx 0.73.</mrow>
            </md>
        </p>
        <p>We now know the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle whose leg is the desired aircraft altitude. This gives us angle-angle-side (first angle is the right angle). This means we can use the Law of Sines to calculate the height.
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{\sin(34.20^\circ)}{h} &amp; = \frac{\sin(90^\circ)}{0.72501447 \text{ mi}}.</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{h}{\sin(34.20^\circ)} &amp; = \frac{0.72501447 \text{ mi}}{\sin(90^\circ)}.</mrow>
                <mrow>h &amp; = \frac{(0.72501447 \text{ mi})\sin(34.20^\circ)}{\sin(90^\circ)}</mrow>
                <mrow> &amp; \approx 0.4075185828</mrow>
                <mrow> &amp; \approx 0.41.</mrow>
            </md>
        This is in miles. It will be easier to interpret in feet. The conversion ratio in <xref ref="table-customary-convert" /> suggests we can multiply <me>(0.40751862 \text{ mi}) \cdot \frac{5280 \text{ ft}}{1 \text{ mi}} \approx 2151.6983 \text{ ft} \approx 2200 \text{ ft}</me>.</p>
