<title>Identifying Rates</title>

<introduction>

    <p>This section addresses the following topics.
        <ul>
            <li>Interpret data in various formats and analyze mathematical models</li>
        </ul>
        This section covers the following mathematical concepts.
        <ul>
            <li>Identify rates as linear, quadratic, exponential, or other (critical thinking)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>So far we have looked at linear models. We will add quadratic, exponential, and some variations in later sections. One of the ways we distinguish between models is by the rate at which they grow. Often the rate at which something is happening is more important than how much there currently is. This section presents two methods for identifying rates from tables of data. How to identify each type by graph is presented in the appropriate chapter and section.</p>

</introduction>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-vary-difference">
    <title>Differences</title>

    <p>One way to measure rates is to look at the differences between data points. Calculating these differences is illustrated in the table below.</p>

    <table xml:id="table-differences-exponential-tien" >
        <title>Tien's Salary</title>

        </tabular>
    </table>

    <p>In order to see how these differences can help us distinguish between linear and other models, consider Vasya's salary in <xref ref="example-graphing-bar1" />. We know that the difference between each year's salary is $5000.00, because we are told that was the raise each year. This is linear model. In contrast Tien's raises are different each year (they grow year to year). This means his salary does not grow linearly.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-differences-lines2">
        <title>Differences for Atmospheric Pressure Model</title>

        <p>Consider the model in <xref ref="example-calculate-slope" />. <xref ref="table-differences-lines2a" /> calculates the differences every 2000 ft. Notice that the differences are all the same namely -2.00. This model is linear.</p>
        <p><xref ref="table-differences-lines2b" /> calculates the differences every 1000 ft. In this table the differences are all -1.00. This still indicates that the model is linear. It does not matter what interval we choose. If the differences over evenly spaced intervals are the same, then the model is linear.</p>
        <p>The differences we obtained do match. Consider <m>\frac{-2.00}{2000} = \frac{-1.00}{1000}</m>. When written as a ratio the differences are the same number.</p>

        <title>Linear Relation</title>
        <statement><p>A relation is <term>linear</term> if and only if the rate of change is constant.</p></statement>
    </definition>

    <p>This states that a linear model grows by the same amount from one step to the next (rate of change or difference). This equal growth results from the ratio <m>m</m> in the form <m>y=mx+b</m>. Consider the specific case <m>y=3x+2</m>. In the table below notice that the differences are all the same and that the difference is 3. 3 is the ratio from the equation. This is always the case. The slope is how fast the line grows.</p>

    <p>Note we used this constant addition property when working with ratio problems like <xref ref="example-ratio-airspeed1" />. Relations defined by fixed ratios like these are linear.</p>

    </exercise>

    <p>For linear data consecutive differences are always the same. The next examples (<xref ref="example-differences-quadratic" /> to <xref ref="example-differences-exponential" />) illustrate known, non-linear data and how the differences for those look.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-differences-quadratic">
        <title>Quadratic Data</title>

        <statement><p>Consider <xref ref="table-differences-quadratic" />. The first differences (what we calculated above) are not the same. Thus this data is not linear.</p>
        <p>However, the first differences increase in a suspiciously simple pattern. Checking the second differences (the differences of the 1st differences) we see a linear pattern. This turns out to be the pattern for all <term>quadratic</term> data.</p></statement>

    <example xml:id="example-differences-exponential">
        <title>Exponential Data</title>

        <statement><p>Consider <xref ref="table-differences-exponential" />. The differences are not the same nor do they show the same pattern of quadratics. However, there is a pattern in the differences. Notice that the differences are exactly equal to the original data. This means that the rate of increase is determined by the current scale. In other words, the bigger it is, the faster it grows. This is the pattern of data that varies exponentially.</p></statement>

    <p>The next example illustrates that the differences for exponential data are not always exactly equal to the data.</p>

However, notice that <m>6=2 \cdot 3</m> <m>18=2 \cdot 9</m>, and <m>54=2 \cdot 27</m>. The differences are double the original numbers. In general for exponential data the differences will be the original data scaled by some number.</p>
            <p>Happily there is an easier way to determine that data is exponential shown in the next section.</p>
