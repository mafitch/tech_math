<introduction>
    <p>This section addresses the following topics.
        <ul>
            <li>Interpret data in various formats and analyze mathematical models</li>
            <li>Read and use mathematical models in a technical document</li>
        </ul>
        This section covers the following mathematical concepts.
        <ul>
            <li>Solve a system of linear equations (skill)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>In <xref ref="example-percent-mixture-sugar" /> we solved a problem with two, different mixtures. In that case we knew how much of each we were adding. In other cases we know what result we want and need to figure out how much of each substance. This section presents a method for answering questions like this involving two or more constraints (equations) at the same time.</p>

</introduction>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-dual-mixture">
    <title>Motivation</title>

    <p>This section provides a first example of a problem involving two, linear equations. It illustrates how we would recognize this type of problem.</p>

    <p>In previous dilution problems, we diluted a mixture using just diluent (water in that case). In other situations we will have two mixtures with different percents that we will combine to obtain a new mixture.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-dual-mixture">
        <title>Combining Mixtures</title>
        <p>Suppose we have 16 oz of 91% isopropyl alcohol and 12 oz of 75% isopropyl alcohol. How much of each do we need to mix to produce <m>10.0</m> oz of 85% alcohol?</p>
        <p>A common technique in mathematics is to start by writing the answer. We will declare that we will use <m>A</m> oz of 91% alcohol and <m>B</m> oz of 75% alcohol. Next we will express our dual constraints using these answers (variables).</p>
        <p>The first constraint is that we end up with 10 oz of solution. Thus <me>A+B = 10.0</me>.</p>
        <p>The second contraint is the percent alcohol. Because our variables are in terms of amount of solution, we need to express the percent alcohol constraint in terms of ounces (not percents). We can obtain amount from percent using the definition of percent. Because the resulting solution will be 85% alcohol there will be <me>(0.85)10.0 = 8.5 \text{ oz}</me>. This will be the result of adding the amounts from each solution (just as in previous mixture problems). Because <m>A</m> oz of the first solution will be added and it is 91% alcohol, it will contribute <m>(0.91)A</m> oz of alcohol. Similarly the second solution will contribute <m>(0.75)B</m> oz of alcohol. Combined we will obtain <me>(0.91)A+(0.75)B = 8.5 \text{ oz}</me>.</p>
        <p>Now we just need a way to solve this pair of equations.</p>
    </example>

    <title>Crossing Lines</title>

    <p>This section connects solving a system of two linear equations to their graphs. Graphs will help us understand why (and when) there should be a solution. The next section provides the method for solving.</p>

    <p>Our goal here is to consider what causes lines to cross. We will do this by looking at a pair of lines and seeing where they cross.</p>

    <p>Recall that a line is a relation (set of points) such that the change between any two, equally spaced points is the same. Often you have heard this described as rise over run or slope. Slope is a geometric interpretation referring to how <term>steep</term> the line is.</p>

    <exercise xml:id="example-steep-crossing">
        <introduction><p>In <xref ref="figure-steep-crossing" /> there are two lines. One goes through point <m>A=(1,3)</m>. It rises at a slope of <m>2/1</m> (two up for each one over). The other line goes through the point <m>B=(1,2)</m> which is below <m>A</m>.</p></introduction>
        <task><p>Use the slider to set the slope of the second line to 3. Does the line cross the one through <m>A</m>? Where (left or right of point <m>B</m>)?</p></task>
        <task><p>Use the slider to set the slope to something bigger than 3. Does the line cross the first one? Where (left or right of point <m>B</m>)?</p></task>
        <task><p>Use the slider to set the slope to 1. Does the line cross the first one? Where (left or right of point <m>B</m>)?</p></task>
        <task><p>In general if either slope is steeper than the other slope will the two lines cross?</p></task>
        <task><p>Can you select a slope for the second line so that these two lines do not cross?</p></task>
    </exercise>

     <p>This next example applies the idea of a line starting lower but rising faster to answer a financial question.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-cross-when">
        <p>Vasya's initial pay was $62,347.23. She received $5,000 raises each year. Pyotr's initial pay was $67,242.33. He receives $3,500 raises each year. If they were both hired in 2012 in what year does Vasya first have a higher salary?</p>
        <p>We could make a table.</p>
            <tabular top="medium" left="medium">
                <col right="medium" width="15%" />
                <col right="medium" width="25%" />
                <col right="medium" width="25%" />
                <row bottom="medium"><cell>Year</cell> <cell>Vasya</cell> <cell>Pyotr</cell> </row>
                <row bottom="medium"><cell>2012</cell> <cell>$62,347.23</cell> <cell>$67,242.33</cell> </row>
                <row bottom="medium"><cell>2013</cell> <cell>$67,347.23</cell> <cell>$70,742.33</cell> </row>
                <row bottom="medium"><cell>2014</cell> <cell>$72,347.23</cell> <cell>$74,242.33</cell> </row>
                <row bottom="medium"><cell>2015</cell> <cell>$77,347.23</cell> <cell>$77,742.33</cell> </row>
                <row bottom="medium"><cell>2016</cell> <cell>$82,347.23</cell> <cell>$81,242.33</cell> </row>
            </tabular>
            <p>We see that is in 2016 that Vasya is first paid more.</p>
        <p>Alternatively we could note that Vasya's raises are $1,500 more each year than Pyotr's raises. This means she closes the gap by $1,500 each year. The difference in their initial salaries is <m>67242.33-62347.23=4895.10</m>. Because she gains by 1500 each year it will take <m>4895.10/1500 = 3.2634 </m> years. Because they receive raises once a year this result must be rounded up to 4 years. Thus she is first paid more in 2016.</p>

    <title>Solving Linear Systems</title>

    <p>This section presents two ways of solving linear systems of this type. The second method is very important for larger systems.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-dual-mixture-solve">
        <p>We will solve the system from <xref ref="example-dual-mixture" />. The two equations are
        <md>
            <mrow>A+B &amp; = 10.0.</mrow>
            <mrow>(0.91)A+(0.75)B &amp; = 8.5.</mrow>
        </md>
        </p>
        <p>Notice we can solve the first equation for <m>B</m>. If we do then we can substitute it into the second equation. The result will be a single equation with only one variable. We already know how to solve equations like that.
        <md>
            <mrow>A+B &amp; = 10.0.</mrow>
            <mrow>B &amp; = 10.0-A.</mrow>
        </md>
        <md>
            <mrow>(0.91)A+(0.75)B &amp; = 8.5.</mrow>
            <mrow>(0.91)A+(0.75)(10.0-A) &amp; = 8.5. &amp; &amp; \text{Substitute B from above}</mrow>
            <mrow>(0.91)A+7.5-(0.75)A &amp; = 8.5. &amp; &amp; \text{Distribute}</mrow>
            <mrow>(0.91)A-(0.75)A &amp; = 8.5-7.5.</mrow>
            <mrow>(0.91-0.75)A &amp; = 1.0.</mrow>
            <mrow>(0.16)A &amp; = 1.0.</mrow>
            <mrow>A &amp; = \frac{1.0}{0.16}</mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; = 6.25.</mrow>
        </md>
        Now that we know that <m>A = 6.25</m> we can substitute that into <m>A+B=10.0</m>. This gives us
        <md>
            <mrow>A+B &amp; = 10.0.</mrow>
            <mrow>6.25+B &amp; = 10.0.</mrow>
            <mrow>B &amp; = 3.75.</mrow>
        </md></p>
        <p>We can check that this works in the other equation (about percent alcohol).
            <md>
                <mrow>(0.91)A+(0.75)B &amp; = </mrow>
                <mrow>(0.91)(6.25)+(0.75)(3.75) &amp; = </mrow>
                <mrow>5.6875+2.8125 &amp; = 8.5.</mrow>
            </md></p>
    </example>

    <p>If we had 7 variables instead of two, substituting would take a while. Instead we can use the following method which is more like solving as we know it, that is isolating a variable. This method is called <term>elimination</term>.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-dual-mixture-eliminate">
        <p>We will solve the system
        <md>
            <mrow>A+B &amp; = 10.0.</mrow>
            <mrow>(0.91)A+(0.75)B &amp; = 8.5.</mrow>
        </md></p>
        <p>In the second line below notice how we modify the first equation to partially match the second one.
        <md>
            <mrow>A+B &amp; = 10.0. &amp; &amp; \text{Original equation 1}</mrow>
            <mrow>-(0.91)(A+B) &amp; = -(0.91)10.0. &amp; &amp; \text{Scale to match 2nd equation}</mrow>
            <mrow>-(0.91)A-(0.91)B &amp; = -9.1. &amp; &amp; \text{Distribute}</mrow>
            <intertext>Now add the two equations.</intertext>
            <mrow>-(0.91)A-(0.91)B &amp; = -9.1. &amp; &amp; \text{Scaled equation 1}</mrow>
            <mrow>(0.91)A+(0.75)B &amp; = 8.5. &amp; &amp; \text{Original equation 2}</mrow>
            <mrow>-(0.16)B &amp; = -0.6. &amp; &amp; \text{Result of adding previous 2 lines}</mrow>
            <mrow>B &amp; = \frac{-0.6}{-0.16}</mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; = 3.75.</mrow>
        </md>
        In the fifth line we added the two equations. Because they had opposite coefficients for <m>A</m>, that variable was eliminated, leaving us with just <m>B</m>. This can always be done with systems of linear equations.</p>
        <p>We finish solving this system the same way as the previous example, by substituting the value of <m>B</m> back into the first equation.
        <md>
            <mrow>A+B &amp; = 10.0.</mrow>
            <mrow>A+3.75 &amp; = 10.0.</mrow>
            <mrow>A &amp; = 6.25.</mrow>
        </md></p>

    <title>Other Cases</title>

    <p>In <xref ref="figure-steep-crossing" /> we discovered a slope that resulted in no intersection. If we were solving a pair of linear equations that represented lines like this, our calculations would not produce a solution. These are known as <term>inconsistent</term> systems. This section provides two examples of such systems and demonstrates how we identify them. For this book, identifying these cases and correctly describing them is all you are expected to do.</p>

        Our work is correct, but the conclusion is clearly false. You can think of this as saying, for a solution to exist 0 must equal -3. Because this is a contradiction, we call the system <term>inconsistent</term>. This means there are no solutions.</p>

        This time we have a true, but rather uninformative statement. We notice that after scaling (multiplying by -2) the two equations were identical. Essentially we had only one equation. Because one can be obtained from the other we call them <term>dependent</term>.</p>
