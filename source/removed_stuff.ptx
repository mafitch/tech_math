		<p>At lower altitudes the temperature typically drops 3.5<degree/> F for every 1000 feet of elevation gained (the air is colder higher up). To produce a model for temperature decrease we will start by calculating the temperature for a couple specific cases.</p>
		<p>If the temperature on the ground is 58<degree/> F what do we expect the temperatue to be on a mountain peak at 4500 ft above ground level?</p>
		<p>The temperature drop is a ratio <m>\frac{3.5^\circ \text{ F}}{1000 \text{ ft}}</m>. The units suggest we can multiply <m>4500 \text{ ft} \cdot \frac{3.5^\circ \text{ F}}{1000 \text{ ft}} = 15.75^\circ \text{ F}</m>. This is the drop in temperature. To calculate the resulting temperature we need <m>58^\circ \text{ F} - 15.75^\circ \text{ F} = 42.25^\circ \text{ F} \approx 42^\circ \text{ F}</m>. We round to the units because we do not need more precision to decide what jacket to wear on the mountain. Written as one calculation this is <m>T = 58-\left(4500 \text{ ft} \cdot \frac{3.5^\circ \text{ F}}{1000 \text{ ft}}\right). </m></p>
		<p>If the temperature on the ground is 53<degree/> F what do we expect the temperatue to be on a mountain peak at 6000 ft above ground level?</p>
		<p>The temperature drop is a ratio <m>\frac{3.5^\circ \text{ F}}{1000 \text{ ft}}</m>. The units suggest we can multiply <m>6000 \text{ ft} \cdot \frac{3.5^\circ \text{ F}}{1000 \text{ ft}} = 21^\circ \text{ F}</m>. This is the drop in temperature. To calculate the resulting temperature we need <m>53^\circ \text{ F} - 21^\circ \text{ F} = 32^\circ \text{ F}</m>. Written as one calculation this is <m>T = 53-\left(6000 \text{ ft} \cdot \frac{3.5^\circ \text{ F}}{1000 \text{ ft}}\right). </m> Notice we have stumbled on the altitude at which the temperature is freezing. Clouds above this level might have ice or snow.</p>
		<p>Notice we could do this same calculation for any altitude. So in general we can write <me>T_A = T_G-\left(A \text{ ft} \cdot \frac{3.5^\circ \text{ F}}{1000 \text{ ft}}\right). </me> <m>T_A</m> is the temperature at the specified altitude. <m>T_G</m> is the temperature at ground level. <m>A</m> is the altitude above ground level. This is a linear equation with a ratio of (-3.5/1000) which is the drop in temperature with altitude, and a shift of <m>T_G</m>, which is the temperature on the ground.</p>
