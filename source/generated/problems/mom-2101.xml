<statement>
<p>Find the slope of the line that goes through the points (15,-13) and (8,3).</p>
<p>
Slope, <m>\displaystyle{m}</m> = <fillin characters="20" /></p>
<p>
Enter your answer as an integer or a reduced fraction in the form A/B</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p><m>\displaystyle\frac{{{3}-{\left(-{13}\right)}}}{{{8}-{\left({15}\right)}}}=\frac{{16}}{{-{{7}}}}</m> which reduces to <m>\displaystyle-\frac{{16}}{{7}}</m> (if it's not already reduced)</p>
