<statement>
<p>A <em>kite</em> is a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacents sides of equal length (think of simple ones you can fly).</p>
<p>
A kite has two sides of length <m>\displaystyle{a}={b}={6.7}</m> and two sides of length <m>\displaystyle{c}={d}={4.8}</m> (all measured in yards).  The angle between the largest sides is <m>\displaystyle\alpha={52}^\circ</m>.</p>
<p>
