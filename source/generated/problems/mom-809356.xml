<p>A rocket launch occurs at <m>\displaystyle{t}={0}</m> seconds.  Its height, in meters above
  sea-level, as a function of time is given by <m>\displaystyle{h}=-{4.9}{t}^{{2}}+{166}{t}+{87}</m>.</p>
<p>Assuming that the rocket will splash down into the ocean, at what time does
  splashdown occur? <fillin characters="10" />seconds.</p>
