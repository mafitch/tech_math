<statement>
<p>A student in a Pre-Calculus class has test scores of 60, 63, 72, and 75. The final exam is worth 2 test grades. </p>
<p>
Write a linear equation that models this problem, where <m>\displaystyle{x}</m> is the grade on the final exam and <m>\displaystyle{y}</m> is the student's grade in the course. The whole grade is based on these tests and the final.</p>
