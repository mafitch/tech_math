<statement>
<p>Many substances are metabolized by our body so that the amount of the substance in our system decreases exponentially.
Sometimes studies state this in terms of "half-life", and sometimes as an hourly rate of decrease.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{A}\cdot{\left(\frac{{1}}{{2}}\right)}^{{\frac{{t}}{{{H}{L}}}}}={A}\cdot{\left({1}-{r}\right)}^{{t}}</m></p>
<p>
Where <m>\displaystyle{A}</m> is the initial amount, <m>\displaystyle{H}{L}</m> is the half-life in hours, <m>\displaystyle{t}</m> is the time in hours, and <m>\displaystyle{r}</m> is the hourly rate of decrease.</p>
<p>
Suppose a substance has a half-life of 7 hours.</p>
<p>
What is the hourly decay rate, to the nearest tenth of a percent?

<solution>
<p>9.4</p>
