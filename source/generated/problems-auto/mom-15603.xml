<statement>
<p>Suppose you start with a full tank of gas (19 gallons) in your truck.  After driving 3 hours, you now have 7 gallons left.</p>
<p>
If x is the number of hours you have been driving, then y is the number of gallons left in the tank.</p>
<p>
At what rate is the gas left in the tank changing? State your answer as a reduced fraction.</p>
<p>
<fillin characters="1" />gallons per hour</p>
