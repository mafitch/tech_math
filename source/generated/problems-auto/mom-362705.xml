<statement>
<p>Load factor refers to the amount of force imposed on an aircrafts body and contents (e.g., pilot). It is typically measured in g-forces. The maximum load factor is calculated by <m>\displaystyle{n}={\left({\frac{{{V}}}{{{V}_{{s}}}}}\right)}^{{2}}</m> where <m>\displaystyle{V}_{{s}}</m> is the stall speed and <m>\displaystyle{V}</m> is the current speed.</p>
<p>The stall speed (<m>\displaystyle{V}_{{s}}</m>) for a Cessna 206 is 54 kias. Maximum structural cruising speed (<m>\displaystyle{V}_{{{N}{O}}}</m>) is 147 kcas. Maneuvering speed (<m>\displaystyle{V}_{{A}}</m>) at this weight is about 122 kcas.</p>
<p>Calculate the V speed for a maximum load factor of 3. Give a numeric approximation rounded to the nearest unit. <fillin characters="20" /></p>
