	<p>A ratio expresses a fixed relationship between two quantities. This section illustrates using ratios to calculate amounts subject to a ratio and presents how to recognize what a ratio does and cannot tell us. Note, percents are simply ratios scaled to parts per 100, that is, what we know about percents is applicable here.</p>

	<title>Example Ratios</title>

	<example xml:id="example-ratio-simple-syrup">
		<p>Simple syrup consists of one cup of sugar and one cup of water which is heated until the sugar is disolved. There are multiple ratios that express this combination. <m>\frac{1 \text{ cup sugar}}{1 \text{ cup water}}</m>, <m>\frac{7.05 \text{ oz}}{8 \text{ oz}}</m> ratio of sugar to water by weight, <m>\frac{7.05 \text{ oz}}{15.05 \text{ oz}}</m> ratio of sugar to simple syrup.</p>
		<p>Each of these ratios indicates that there is a fixed amount of sugar relative to the water or resulting syrup. That is, is if we made simple syrup with 2 cups of sugar we would need 2 cups of water because <me>\frac{2 \text{ cups sugar}}{2 \text{ cups water}} = \frac{1 \text{ cup sugar}}{1 \text{ cup water}}</me> by reducing fractions.</p>
	</example>

	<example xml:id="example-ratio-pets1">
		<p>In a neighborhood there are 7 dogs and 12 cats. To express the relative number dogs and cats we can write the ratio <me>\frac{7 \text{ dogs}}{12 \text{ cats}}</me></p>
		<p>Note that <m>\frac{7}{12} \approx 0.58 \lt 1</m>. Because it is less than one the ratio tells us that there are fewer dogs than cats in this neighborhood.</p>
		<p>We could also write <m>\frac{12 \text{ cats}}{7 \text{ dogs}}</m> to express the exact same relationship. Note that <m>\frac{12}{7} \approx 1.7 \gt 1</m>. Because it is greater than one the ratio tells us that there are more cats than dogs in the neighborhood (same result as above).</p>
	</example>

	<example xml:id="example-ratio-rate1">
		<p>Rates are expressed as ratios. The following rates are all written as ratios. <me>\frac{35 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}}</me> <me>\frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{1 \text{ minute}}</me> Notice that these (and most rates) are expressed with the denominator being one. This makes it easier to calculate as will be seen below. Frequently we will skip writing the one in the denominator, e.g., <m>\frac{35 \text{ miles}}{\text{hour}}</m>.</p>
		<p>Rates are not required to have a denominator of one and sometimes a different denominator is easier for calculation. For example <me>\frac{3 \text{ nm}}{2 \text{min}}=\frac{1.5 \text{ nm}}{1 \text{ min}}</me></p>
	</example>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-using-ratios">
	<title>Using Ratios</title>

	<p>Just like percents (which are ratios written in decimal form) if we know a ratio and one of the amounts we can calculate the other amount. The method is the same as with percents, namely multiplying the correct number or solving an equation.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-ratio-airspeed1">
		<title>Ratio: Airspeed</title>
		<p>The Diamond DA-20 cruises at the rate (speed) of <me>\frac{110 \text{ nautical miles}}{1 \text{ hour}}</me>. Cruise is a portion of flight in which the speed is typically constant. How far can the plane cruise in 2.5 hours?</p>
		<p>The units suggest we can multiply these. <me>\frac{110 \text{ nm}}{1 \text{ hr}} \cdot 2.5 \text{ hr} = 275 \text{ nm}</me>. This works because we are multiplying by hours and dividing by hours which leaves us with nautical miles as desired.</p>
	</example>

	<example xml:id="example-ratio-airspeed2">
		<title>Ratio: Airspeed by Table</title>
		<p>There is another approach to the same question.</p>
		<p>The Diamond DA-20 cruises at the rate (speed) of <me>\frac{110 \text{ nautical miles}}{1 \text{ hour}}</me>. Cruise is a portion of flight in which the speed is typically constant. How far can the plane cruise in 2.5 hours?</p>
		<p>Because this ratio remains the same during cruise we can break the problem down into pieces. Based on the ratio (speed) in the first hour the plane will cruise 110 nm. In the second hour it will cruise another 110 nm. In the last half hour it will fly half of the distance which is <m>110/2=55</m> nm. Thus in 2.5 hours it will cruise <m>110+110+55=275</m> nm.</p>
		<p> Some manuals provide tables to make this method convenient. See <xref ref="table-ratio-airspeed1" /> for a table of this sort. How far can the DA-20 cruise in 2.7 hours? We need to write 2.7 as the sum of numbers in the table. One way is <m>2.7 = 2+0.5+0.2</m>. From the table we know it will cruise 220 nm in 2 hours, 55 nm in an additional 0.5 hours, and 22 nm in the final 0.2 hours. Thus it will cruise <m>220+55+22=297</m> nm.</p>
		<p>While this method makes sense, it takes more time than simply multiplying.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-ratio-volume">
		<statement><p>Water is flowing out of a hose at a rate of 11 gallons per minute. How many gallons have come out after 2.7 minutes?</p></statement>
		<solution><p>We can set this up like the calculation in <xref ref="example-ratio-airspeed1" />. In that example multiplied the ratio (nm/hr) by the number of hours which gave us nm. Here we multiply the ratio (gal/min) by the number of minutes which will give us gallons. <me>\frac{11  \text{ gal}}{1 \text{ min}} \cdot 2.7 \text{ min} = 29.7 \text{ gal} \approx 30 \text{ gal}.</me>
		Here we use significant digits because these are measurements.</p></solution>

		<solution><p>We can use the ratio <m>\frac{0.022 \; \text{mg}}{1 \; \ell}</m>. We apply this ratio to the given volume of 0.0020 liters. <me>\frac{0.022 \text{ mg}}{1 \; \ell} \cdot 0.0020 \; \ell = 0.000044 \text{ mg}</me>

	<p>The method for ratios that have a number other than one in the denominator is the same.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-ratio-apply-saline">
		<statement><p>A saline solution intended for nasal rinsing has a ratio of 2.5 g of salt (sodium chloride) per 240 mL of pure water. How much salt is needed to make a half liter of saline solution?</p></statement>
		<solution><p>We can apply the given ratio (2.5 g/240 mL) to the given amount (0.5 L). First it will be convenient to convert a half liter to milliliters. This is also a ratio problem. See <xref ref="table-metric-sizes" /> for the conversion ratio. <me>\frac{1000 \text{ mL}}{1 \text{ L}} \cdot 0.5 \text{ L} = 500 \text{ mL}.</me>
		Next we can multiply the saline solution ratio by the volume. <me>\frac{2.5 \text{ g}}{240 \text{mL}} \cdot 500 \text{ mL} = 5.2 \text{ g}.</me>
		Note we use two significant digits because the measurements 2.5 and 240 both have two significant digits. The 500 is part of a definition so it has infinite significant digits.</p></solution>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-ratio-conversion">
	<title>Conversion of Units</title>

	<p>One common type of ratio is a rate. These typically have units. Examples you probably know are miles per hour, kilometers per hour, and gallons per minute. When we know a rate we can calculate amounts (e.g., number of miles, number of kilometers, or number of gallons). Sometimes we convert one unit to another. This is accomplished by applying ratios as we did in <xref ref="example-ratio-apply-mercury" /> .</p>

	<example xml:id="example-unit-conversion-scale">
		<statement><p>Find the ratio of 5 cm to 40 mm.</p></statement>
		<solution><p>We can write simply <me>\frac{5 \text{ cm}}{40 \text{ mm}}</me> but the mismatched units make this less informative than it could be. We know 5 cm is 50 mm, so the ratio could also be written <me>\frac{50 \text{ mm}}{40 \text{ mm}}=\frac{5 \text{ mm}}{4 \text{ mm}}.</me> Note it is equally valid to note that 40 mm is 4 cm and write the ratio <me>\frac{5 \text{ cm}}{4 \text{ cm}}.</me> Note that the units do not affect the ratio when it is reduced.</p></solution>
