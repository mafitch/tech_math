<title>Sine Wave Properties</title>

<introduction>

    <p>This section addresses the following topics.
        <ul>
            <li>Read and use mathematical models in a technical document</li>
            <li>Communicate results in mathematical notation and in language appropriate to the technical field</li>
        </ul>
        This section covers the following mathematical concepts.
        <ul>
            <li>Use models including linear, quadratic, exponential/logarithmic, and trigonometric (skill)</li>
            <li>Identify properties of sine and cosine functions (skill)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>We began by looking at trigonometric functions in the context of triangles where they represent the ratio of side lengths. Here we will consider trigonometric functions in the context of properties of their graphs. The graphs have direct applications.</p>

</introduction>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-angles">
    <title>Beyond Triangles</title>

    <p>This section illustrates how trigonometric functions can be defined on angles greater than 180<degree/>. In triangles every angle had to be less than 180<degree/> because the sum of the angles of a triangle are only 180<degree/>. However, in many applications rather than measuring angles on objects (like triangles), we are measuring how far or how many times around something has moved. For example a wheel on a car moves more than 180<degree/> when we are driving. Use <xref ref="activity-discover-big-angles" /> to explore this idea.</p>

            <shortdescription>Graph of portion of a sine curve from -180 to 720 degrees</shortdescription>
            <description>
                <p>The horizontal axis ranges from -180 to 720 in increments of 90. The vertical axis ranges from -1 to 1. The graph of sine on this portion consists of 5 humps that are 180 wide and alternate down (starting at -180) and up. From 0 to 720 there are two complete up/down pairs.</p>
            </description>
        </image>
    </figure>

    <p>From the first section we know that the graph of sine is a wave that repeats. The piece that is repeated is called a <term>cycle</term>. In the default graph this is from 0<degree/> to 360<degree/> as shown in <xref ref="figure-graph-sine" />.</p>

    <p>The length of the cycle can be modified. Depending on the application we interpret and measure the length of the cycle differently. This section defines two traits of the cycle, illustrates the traits, and gives an alternate definition for one trait.</p>

    <definition xml:id="definition-period">
        <title>Period</title>
        <statement><p>The length of a cycle measured in time is called the <term>period</term>.</p></statement>
    </definition>

    <definition xml:id="definition-wavelength">
        <title>Wavelength</title>
        <statement><p>The length of a cycle measured in distance is called the <term>wavelength</term>.</p></statement>
    </definition>

    <p>The video below illustrates the difference between wavelength and period of a sine wave. The top two sine curves have the same wavelength (2), and the bottom two sine curves have the same wavelength (1). We can see this because the top two curves have one cycle from 0 to 2, and the bottom two curves have one cycle from 0 to 1. This implies the bottom curves have a wavelength that is half that of those on top.</p>

    <p>The left two sine curves have the same period. They complete one cycle in one (1) seconds. The right two sine curves have the same period. They complete one cycle in two (2) seconds.</p>

    <video youtube="xf0YjGESl-M" xml:id="video-wave-period-wavelength" />

    <p>Sometimes instead of measuring how long a single cycle is in units of time, we measure how many cycles occur in a fixed unit of time. This is called <term>frequency</term>.</p>

    <definition xml:id="definition-frequency">
        <title>Frequency</title>
        <statement><p>The number of cycles that occur per second is called the <term>frequency</term>. This is typically measured in Hertz (Hz). 1 Hz is one cycle per second.</p></statement>
    </definition>

    <p>Note that frequency is the inverse of the period as shown below. In the video the sine waves above, the sine waves on the right have a period of two (2) and a frequency of <m>1/2</m>.</p>

    <table xml:id="table-period-frequency">

    </table>

    <example xml:id="example-period-frequency">
        <p>If a wave has a period of <m>1/3</m> seconds, what is its frequency?</p>
        <p>We can see how many <m>1/3</m> of a second there are in one second. That is
        <md>
            <mrow>f \cdot \frac{1}{3} \amp = 1</mrow>
            <mrow>f \amp = 3</mrow>
        </md> The frequency is 3.</p>
        <p>We can consider this a conversion of units. If the period is <me>\frac{1/3 \text{ seconds}}{\text{cycle}}</me> and frequency is in cycles per second what we want is to remove the 1/3 from the denominator (turn it into 1).
        <md>
            <mrow>\frac{\text{cycles}}{1/3 \text{ seconds}} \amp = </mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{\text{cycles}}{1/3 \text{ seconds}} \cdot \frac{3}{3} \amp = \frac{3 \text{ cycles}}{\text{ second}}</mrow>
        </md></p>
    </example>

    <p>Generally, if the period is <m>T</m> then the frequency is <me>f=\frac{1}{T}.</me></p>

    <example xml:id="example-wave-length-sound">
        <p>What are the period and wavelength of middle C which has a frequency of 261.63 Hz? This is a measurement in a science model so we will use significant digits.</p>
        <p>Because we know the frequency we can directly calculate the period.

            <mrow>261.63 \amp = \frac{1}{T}.</mrow>

            <mrow> \amp \approx 0.0038222</mrow>
        </md>.</p>
        <p>For the wavelength we need to know that the speed of sound is 1116 feet/second. Now we can use the fact that Hz is cycles per second to convert frequency (cycles per second) to wavelength (feet per cycle). The units suggest that we multiply as follows. <me>\frac{\text{second}}{261.63 \text{ cycles}} \cdot \frac{1116 \text{ feet}}{\text{second}} \approx 4.265\underline{5}65875 \approx 4.266 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{cycle}}.</me></p>
