    <title>Re-arranging Rational Expressions</title>

    <p>In previous sections many of the models involving rational (fractional) expressions could be set up so we solved for a variable in the numerator. In this section we look at multiple examples in which we must solve for a variable in the denominator.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Outer diameter is labeled as the length of a line going from the tip of one gear tooth to the tip of the gear tooth diametrically opposed. Pitch diameter is labeled as the length of a diameter of a circle drawn roughly half way between bottom and top of the gear teeth. That circle is rubbing against the matching circle of the second gear (as if these were toothless wheels).</p>

        <title>Gear Design</title>
        <statement>
            <p>For ANSI standard gears there is a relationship between the number of teeth, and diameters of the gear. <me>D_p = \frac{D_o N}{N+2}</me> where
            <ul>
                <li><m>N</m> is the total number of teeth</li>

                <li><m>D_p</m> is the pitch diameter.</li>
            </ul> Outer diameter is the diameter of a circle that contains the tips of the teeth. Pitch diameter is the diameter of a circle such that this gear touches the other gear at this distance. It is illustrated as the dashed circles in the figure above.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-rational-calculate-number-teeth">
        <p>Suppose we know the outer diameter (17/8") and pitch diameter (2") needed for a gear. What are the steps to solve for the number of teeth? The number of teeth must end up an integer (half a gear tooth is just a broken gear). Thus there will be no rounding. If the calculation gives a non-integer result, we must change something in the design.</p>
        <p>First we convert the outer diameter to decimal: <m>17/8=2.125</m>. The model is

<subsection xml:id="subsection-rational-rates">
    <title>Rates</title>

    <p>There are many times when we need to calculate the rate at which something can be accomplished when more than one person/thing is working on it. This section illustrates how to obtain a resulting rate from the individual rates. This process requires algebra similar to that above.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-joint-work1">
        <title>Joint Work: Draining Basement</title>

        <p>A company has two pumps available for draining flooded basements. One pump can drain a basement in 4 hours, whereas the other pump can do the job in only 3 hours. How long would it take to drain the basement if both pumps are used simulataneously?</p>
        <p>The question is how to calculate the speed of the combined pumps. Adding a pump should increase the speed. Thus we want to determine a way to add the speeds. We can start by writing down the rates to see what that suggests. The first pump operates at a rate of <m>\frac{1 \text{ basement}}{4 \text{ hours}}</m> and the second pump operates at a rate of <m>\frac{1 \text{ basement}}{3 \text{ hours}}</m>. Because rates are ratios (fractions), and the units match, we know how to add them. The combined rate is
        <md>
            <mrow>\text{Joint Rate} &amp; = \frac{1 \text{ basement}}{4 \text{ hours}} + \frac{1 \text{ basement}}{3 \text{ hours}} \text{ Need a common denominator}</mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; =\frac{3}{3} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ basement}}{4 \text{ hours}} + \frac{4}{4} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ basement}}{3 \text{ hours}} \text{ Scaling accomplishes this}</mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; =\frac{3 \text{ basement}}{12 \text{ hours}} + \frac{4 \text{ basement}}{12 \text{ hours}}</mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; = \frac{7 \text{ basement}}{12 \text{ hours}}</mrow>
        </md>. We did not convert to decimal notation, because we will be setting up a proportion, so we want the rate in fraction form.</p>
        <p>The next step is to use this rate to determine how long it takes to empty one basement. This is setting up a proportion.
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{7 \text{ basement}}{12 \text{ hours}} &amp; = \frac{1 \text{ basement}}{N \text{ hours}}.</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{12 \text{ hours}}{7 \text{ basement}} &amp; = \frac{N \text{ hours}}{1 \text{ basement}}.</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{12 \text{ hours}}{7 \text{ basement}} \cdot (1 \text{ basement}) &amp; = \frac{N \text{ hours}}{1 \text{ basement}} \cdot (1 \text{ basement}). </mrow>
                <mrow>1.714285714 \text{ hours} &amp; \approx N.</mrow>
                <mrow>1.72 \text{ hours} &amp; \approx N.</mrow>
            </md> Given this is in hours it makes sense to round to the hundredths (a little less than a minute). It also makes sense to round up (better to expect the worst and be happy it was better). We expect the two pumps to complete the work in 1.72 hours (a little less than 1 hour and 45 minutes).</p>
        <p>Because the denominator was 1 basement, when we cleared the denominator (cross multiplication) all we did was adjust the units (basement/basement divides out). This suggests we could have simply scaled the combined rate to obtain the final result. <me>\frac{1/7}{1/7} \cdot \frac{7 \text{ basement}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1 \text{ basement}}{1.72 \text{ hours}}</me>. Thus if both pumps are working it will take 1.72 hours drain the basement.</p>
        <p>The increase in speed results in less time required to complete the job. This is why the faster rate (1 basement per 1.72 hours) has a smaller denominator (1.72 vs 3 or 4).</p>

        <p>Because the question asks us to determine combined speed, we recognize this as a <q>joint work</q> problem.
