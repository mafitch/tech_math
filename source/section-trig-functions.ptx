    <p>For a right triangle each of the other two angles have measure less than a right angle. This is a result of the <xref ref="theorem-triangle-angle-sum" text="title" /> theorem. <m>180^\circ-90^\circ=90^\circ</m> so the remaining two angles have a sum that adds to <m>90^\circ</m>. This implies both non-right angles are smaller than a right angle.</p>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-trig-ratios-defined">
    <title>Defining Trig Functions</title>

    <p>This section presents the trigonometric functions and demonstrates that they make sense. First, we need terminology with which to describe right triangles.</p>

    <p>For right triangles we have names for the sides. Consider the labels in <xref ref="figure-triangle-side-names" />. These names are relative to the particular non-right angles with which we are working. In this case it is the one labeled <m>\alpha</m>. The <term>adjacent</term> is the side that connects the angle <m>\alpha</m> and the right angle. The <term>opposite</term> is the side touching the right angle but not touching the angle (<m>\alpha</m>). Both the adjacent and opposite sides are known as <term>legs</term> of the right triangle. The <term>hypotenuse</term> is opposite the right angle (the one side not touching it).</p>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-solving-triangles">
    <title>Solving Triangles</title>

    <p>Now that we have defined trigonometric functions, we can use them to analyze triangles. The goal is to calculate all of the side lengths and/or angles given only some of them.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-triangle-solve4">
        <p>For a right triangle with angle <m>\alpha=50^\circ</m> and corresponding opposite side of length 7, what are the other side lengths and angles?</p>
        <p>First, we know that two of the angles are <m>90^\circ</m> and <m>50^\circ</m>, so the third angle has measure <m>180^\circ-90^\circ-50^\circ = 40^\circ</m>.</p>
        <p>To calculate the length of the hypotenuse recall that <m>sin(\alpha)=\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}</m>. We know the angle and the length of the opposite.

<subsection xml:id="subsection-trig-function-application">
    <title>Calculating lengths using trig functions</title>

    <p>This section demonstrates using trigonometric functions to calculate lengths in an application when we know an angle and a side length.</p>

    <p>First, we define terminology we need to describe the applications.</p>

    <definition xml:id="definition-angle-elevation">
        <title>Angle of Elevation</title>
        <statement><p>The <term>angle of elevation</term> of an object or observation is the angle measured from level (often the ground) up to the object (or line of sight).</p></statement>
    </definition>

    <definition xml:id="definition-angle-depression">
        <title>Angle of Depression</title>
        <statement><p>The <term>angle of depression</term> of an object or observation is the angle measured from level down to the object (or line of sight).</p></statement>
    </definition>

    <figure xml:id="figure-view-angle-illustration">
        <caption>Illustrations of Angles of Elevation and Depression</caption>
        <image source="images/view_angle_definitions" width="50%" >
            <shortdescription>Image of a person looking from a balcony on one side of a street at the building across the street</shortdescription>
            <description>
                <p>The observer is on a balcony on the second story of a building. There is a horizontal line from the viewer across to the building on the other side of the street. There is another line from the observer to the top of the building across the street. The angle between the horizontal and the view of the top is labeled angle of elevation.</p>
                <p>A third line goes from the observer to the bottom of the building across the street. The angle between the horizontal and the bottom of the building is labeled angle of depression.</p>
            </description>
        </image>
    </figure>

    <p>For all of these applications our first task is to recognize a right triangle in the problem. We must also identify what the two legs and/or the hypotenuse are in the application. Then we can set up an equation using a trigonometric function, and use the equation to calculate something.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-apply-ladder-height">
        <p>For safety reasons the optimal angle of elevation of a ladder is 75<degree/>. If the ladder is 16 ft long, at what height will the top of the ladder be resting against a wall? We can measure a tenth of a foot but not very easily measure a hundredth of a foot, especially for placing a ladder.</p>
        <p>First, it is often useful to sketch an image. This makes it easier to identify triangles or other shapes. Note the sketch does not need to be artistic.</p>
        <image source="images/ladder_sketch" width="30%" >
            <shortdescription>Sketch of the ladder against a wall described above.</shortdescription>
        </image>
        <p>We notice that the ladder forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with the ground and the wall. Next we identify details. We know an angle (75<degree/> angle of elevation from the ground) and the length of the hypotenuse (length of the ladder). We want the length of the side opposite the angle (height along the wall). From this information (opposite, hypotenuse, angle) we can recognize the need for the sine function.</p>
        <p><md>
            <mrow>\sin(\theta) &amp; = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}</mrow>
            <mrow>\sin(75^\circ) &amp; = \frac{h}{16}</mrow>
            <mrow>16\sin(75^\circ) &amp; = h</mrow>
            <mrow>15.45 &amp; \approx B</mrow>
        </md> Thus the top of the ladder is 15.5 feet up the wall.</p>
        <p>Why round to one decimal place? A hundredth of a foot is much less than an inch. This would make no difference in any application. Rounding to the nearest foot (units) would ignore as much as a half foot which could make a difference.</p>
     </example>

     <example xml:id="example-apply-ladder-distance">
        <p>We may also wish to know how far from the wall to place the bottom of the ladder. That is calculating the length of the side adjacent to the angle of elevation, so we use the cosine function.</p>
        <p><md>
            <mrow>\cos(75^\circ) &amp; = \frac{A}{16}</mrow>
            <mrow>16\cos(75^\circ) &amp; = A</mrow>
            <mrow>4.14 &amp; \approx A</mrow>
        </md> Thus we place the ladder a little more than 4 feet from the wall.</p>
        <p>If we had already calculated the height up the wall (previous example) we could also use the Pythagorean Theorem.</p>
        <p><md>
            <mrow>A^2+15.45^2 &amp; = 16^2</mrow>
            <mrow>A^2 &amp; = 16^2-15.45^2</mrow>
            <mrow>A^2 &amp; = 256-238.7025</mrow>
            <mrow>A^2 &amp; = 17.2975</mrow>
            <mrow>A &amp; = \sqrt{17.2975}</mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; \approx 4.1590</mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; \approx 4.16</mrow>
        </md> This is quite close to the previous solution, specifically the difference is too small to effect ladder placement. The difference is the result of using the 15.45 length which was rounded.</p>
    </example>

     <example xml:id="example-apply-measure-height">
        <p>Measuring the heights of tall objects is a use of trigonometry that has been around for millenia.</p>
        <p>We want to determine the height of a tree, but dropping a measuring tape from the top is impractical. Instead we can use its shadow, which being on the ground, is easier to access.</p>

        <p>The sun casts a shadow of a tree on the ground. The distance from the top of the shadow to the base of the tree is measured to be 103 ft (this is the length of the shadow). From the end of the shadow the angle of elevation to the sun is measured to be 63<degree/>. How tall is the tree? Round using significant digits because this is based on measurements. We do not want to claim a precision about the height which is not valid.</p>
        <p>The tree, shadow, and line to the sun form a right triangle with angle 63<degree/>, and an adjacent side length of 103 ft. The height of the tree is the length of the opposite leg. Because we know the adjacent and want the opposite we use the tangent function.

    <p>While angle size and triangle side length is connected, we can always scale a triangle (e.g., make it twice as large) without changing the angles and hence not changing the trig function values. This is why the trig functions are defined as ratios: the scale is divided out.</p>

    <p>Another way to look at this is to recall similar triangles (<xref ref="subsection-proportion-similar" />). The ratios between corresponding sides of two, similar triangles is fixed (all three ratios are the same value). This means ratios of sides of one triangle will be the same as ratios of sides of the other triangle: one will be expressed in non-reduced form. The next examples illustrate this idea.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-trig-ratio-scale1">
        <p>Consider a right triangle with side lengths 8, 15, and 17. If <m>A</m> is the angle opposite from the side of length 8, then <m>\sin(A)=\frac{8}{17}</m>.</p>
        <p>Next consider a right triangle with side lengths 16, 30, and 34. If <m>A^\prime</m> is the angle across from 16, then <m>\sin(A^\prime)=\frac{16}{34}=\frac{8}{17}</m>. This is the same ratio as the previous triangle although the triangle is larger (double in each side length).</p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-trig-ratio-scale2">
        <p>Consider the right triangle with side lengths 8, 15, and 17. If we scale this triangle until the side of length 8 is now length 40, what are the other side lengths?</p>
        <p>If <m>A</m> is the angle opposite from the side of length 8 in the original triangle, then <m>\sin(A)=\frac{8}{17}</m>. Scaling the triangle does not change the angles, so the new triangle has an angle with the same angle measure as <m>A</m>, call it <m>A^\prime</m>. Putting these together gives us the following.
        <md>
            <mrow>\sin(A) &amp; = \sin(A^\prime).</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{8}{17} &amp; = \frac{40}{h}.</mrow>
            <mrow>h &amp; = \frac{40 \cdot 17}{8}</mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; = 85</mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; = 17 \cdot 5.</mrow>
        </md> The last line is included to show how the hypotenuse is scaled the same way the opposite leg is. We could use tangent to show the other leg is also scaled by 5, that is the adjacent leg will be length <m>15 \cdot 5 = 75</m>.</p>
    </example>

    <p>The <xref ref="theorem-pythagorean" text="title" /> tells us that if we know two sides of a right triangle, the length of the third side is already determined. This means there are restrictions on the side lengths from which a right triangle can be assembled.</p>
