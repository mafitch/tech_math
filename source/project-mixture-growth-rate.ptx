	<title>Project: Constraints on Dilution</title>

<introduction>
	<p>Curiosity is an important mathematical virtue. We have seen limitations on the results we can obtain when diluting a mixture. This project guides us through conclusions on those constraints and asks at what rate it grows. Each question is worth I DONT KNOW points.</p>

    <p>In <xref ref="section-mixture" /> we learned to calculate percents for mixtures and how to dilute a mixture to a specified percent.</p>

    <p>By adding water we can of course not increase the percent alcohol, so if we start with 91% alcohol 91% is the highest we can achieve. On the other side we can reduce the percent alcohol to as little as we want (not quite to 0%) if we dilute it enough. This dilution requires not restricting the final volume. This pair of restrictions should make us wonder about a relationship between the desired volume and the minimum/maximum amount of alchol.</p>
</introduction>

<task>
    <p>This first question is the same as <xref ref="example-calculate-dilute" />. Use it to check your understanding of the process.</p>

<!--    <exercise xml:id="exercise-calculate-dilute">
        <webwork>
            <statement><p>Suppose we want 20.0 oz of 70.0% alcohol solution. How much water should we add? <var name="'4.9'" width="4" /> How much solution will we have? <var name="'20.9'" width="4" /></p></statement>
            <solution><p>This is a percent problem with the total alcohol unchanged (<m>(0.91)16=14.56</m>) and adding only some amount <m>w</m> of water. Thus we setup
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\frac{(0.910)16.0}{16.0+w} \amp = 0.700</mrow>
                        <mrow>(0.910)16.0 \amp = 0.700(16.0+w)</mrow>
                        <mrow>(0.910)16.0 \amp = (0.700)16.0+(0.700)w</mrow>
                        <mrow>14.6 \amp = 11.2+(0.700)w</mrow>
                        <mrow>3.4 \amp = (0.700)w</mrow>
                        <mrow>\frac{3.4}{0.700} \amp = w</mrow>
                        <mrow>4.9 \amp \approx w</mrow>
                    </md>
                Thus we end up with <m>16+4.9=20.9</m> oz of the new solution.</p>
            <p>We can confirm this work by calculating the percent water. The percent alcohol is <me>\frac{0.910(16.0)}{16.0+4.9}=0.70</me> which is 70%.</p></solution>

<task>
    <p>Next we will illustrate that for a desired volume, we cannot obtain every percent.</p>

<!--    <exercise xml:id="exercise-calculate-dilute2">
        <webwork>
            <statement>
                <p>If we start with 16.0 oz of 91.0% alcohol solution, how much water do we add if we want 25.0 oz of a 60.0% alcohol solution? <var name="'8.56'" width="4" /></p>
                <p>How much solution total does this produce? <var name="'24.6'" width="4" /></p>
            </statement>
        </webwork>
    </exercise> -->
</task>

<task>
    <p>Notice that we did not produce 25 oz but a little less. One question we can ask then is <q>what is the percent alcohol solution we can obtain for a given volume?</q></p>

<!--        <title>Exact Volume Dilution</title> -->

    <p>If we start with 16.0 oz of 91.0% alcohol solution and we want exactly 20.0 oz of solution, what is the percent alcohol we can obtain?</p></statement>
        <solution><p>If we call the percent alcohol <m>P</m> then the percent water is <m>(1-P)</m>. Thus the final solution will have <me>(1-P)20.0 \text{ oz}</me> of water. We already have <me>0.0900 \cdot 16.0 = 1.44 \text{ oz}</me> of water. Thus we need <me>(1-P)20.0-1.44</me> oz of water. The total volume then will be <me>(1-P)20.0-1.44+16.0=20.0 \text{ oz}</me> Solving this tells us the percentage possible is
        <md>
            <mrow>(1-P)20.0-1.44+16.0 &amp; = 20.0</mrow>
            <mrow>(1-P)20.0 +14.6 &amp; = 20.0</mrow>
            <mrow>(1-P)20.0 &amp; = 5.4</mrow>
            <mrow>1-P &amp; = \frac{5.4}{20.0}</mrow>
            <mrow> -P &amp; = \frac{5.4}{20.0}-1</mrow>
            <mrow> P &amp; = 1-\frac{5.4}{20.0}</mrow>
            <mrow> P &amp; \approx 0.73</mrow>
        </md>
        Thus the percent we obtain for exactly 20.0 oz is 73%.</p></solution>
