        <title>For Students</title>

        <p>This book is intended for use as lessons in a course that emphasizes building the skills to read and use mathematics (such as in a technical manual), and to recognize mathematical concepts in things you see and read in life.</p>

        <p>This book is written to demonstrate effective thought processes, and provide the reader with practice learning to analyze examples and apply examples to similar, not solely identical, problems.</p>

        <p>The general approach is to provide initial examples, present general concepts used in the examples, and then provide a chance to practice the concept or skill. There are two types of special examples. One demonstrates the entire thought process used to figure out what to do. These are much longer and ill suited to use as examples when working on an assignment. Another special example are those that illustrate using an example (examples on how to use an example). These are also longer as they show the thought process for connecting pieces of a question to a sufficiently similar problem.</p>

        <p>By design there are exercises for which there is no step-by-step example in the section. This book is not written as a how to manual for specific applications. When you encounter these problems, as needed, refer to the examples illustrating thought processes. Mimic the thinking skills. You will go farther in life with general thinking skills than you will with memorizing specific processes.</p>

        <title>For Faculty</title>

        <p>This book is designed to be used for classes supporting trade programs in a variety of fields and also to satisfy baccalaureate general education requirements.</p>

        <p>Because of the focus on trade programs, choices of topics and the extent to which they are covered is more limited than in other texts. Also examples are designed to look like how a person in a trade would actually perform the calculations. This includes the assumption that all arithmetic will be performed by a device and hence all numbers will be in decimal notation.</p>

        <p>The inclusion of general education outcomes motivates inclusion of the <q>life</q> portion of the book: these are applications that are not restricted to use in one or more trades. They enable any person to process simple phenomena they experience. The quantitative literacy sections also contribute to the general education goals. Many topics will conclude with activities designed to help readers see limitations of models and learn to process mathematical information with an appropriately critical eye.</p>

        <p>This book is also designed to be used in conjunction with active learning pedagogies rather than as a reference text. That is, it has been designed for students to read the examples, work initial problems to help them identify questions, and to then seek help while working on exercises. It can be easily incorporated into flipped classrooms and asynchronous learning. It intentionally does not provide an example to mimic for each question in the exercises. Rather each section provides an simple example, a more complex example, and some explanation about what is important. Then exercises are provided for them to test their ability to recognize and use the mathematics from that section.</p>

        <p>Another motivation of this text was that existing texts fall into the trap of providing examples to mimic without requiring the student to understand why it worked and hence are not enabled to process new questions. The student statment <q>I didn't see an example for this problem</q> is emblamatic of this issue.</p>

        <p>The check points (exercises in the reading) are self-grading (using MyOpenMath) with feedback so the reader can determine what if any questions they need to ask. Videos, where included, are presentations of the introduction of the concept in that section. Homework by default is live, online problems that provide feedback. The scores on these cannot be saved in an LMS however. If you wish to use MyOpenMath, the problems, and even a shell, can be provided. If desired the PDF version can be used which does not have live homework.</p>

        <p>The projects are an integral part of the general education goals. These are intended to be assigned after relevant material is covered. They require students to use topics from that chapter to perform calculations and then interpret the results of their work. This is part of achieving general education outcomes. The projects also provide a opportunity for students to express calculations using standard mathematical notation and to communicate mathematical results in clear language.</p>

        <p>For context, here is a brief history. The first version of this text was written to transition to an OER for MATH A104 Technical Mathematics at the Univesity of Alaska Anchorage. Commercially available texts emphasized memorizing problem types with limited critical thinking. As such they could not be used to satisfy the general education requirement. There was also a desire to reduce costs including for textbooks and online homework systems. As a result this book was created with matching homework in MyOpenMath.</p>

        <p>Served disciplines at UAA included auto/diesel, heavy equipment mechanics, welding and non-destructive testing, aviation mechanics, piloting, air traffic controll, and medical certification programs.</p>

        <p>The general education outcome around which this was designed was: Quantitative courses develop abilities to reason mathematically and analyze quantitative and qualitative data to reach sound conclusions for success in undergraduate study and professional life. The indicators were
            <ul>
                <li>Interprets info in mathematical form (equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words)</li>
                <li>Represents and/or converts relevant quant info and explain its assumptions and limits</li>
                <li>Applies mathematical forms (equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words) to quantitative problems to reach sound conclusions</li>
                <li>Communicates quantitative results appropriate to the problem or context</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
