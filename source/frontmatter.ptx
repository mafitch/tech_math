        <p>This book is designed to be used for classes supporting trade programs in a variety of fields and also to satisfy baccalaureate general education requirements. The first version was written to transition to an OER for MATH A104 Technical Mathematics at the Univesity of Alaska Anchorage. Served disciplines included auto and heavy equipment mechanics, welding and non-destructive testing, aviation mechanics, pilots and air traffic controller, and medical certification programs.</p>

        <p>Because of a desire to enable students in these programs to extend their studies into a baccalaureate, the course was designed to fufill the general education requirements meaning the students would not need to take another mathematics or quantitative literacy course. The general education outcome was: Quantitative courses develop abilities to reason mathematically and analyze quantitative and qualitative data to reach sound conclusions for success in undergraduate study and professional life. The indicators were
            <ul>
                <li>Interprets info in mathematical form (equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words)</li>
                <li>Represents and/or converts relevant quant info and explain its assumptions and limits</li>
                <li>Applies mathematical forms (equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words) to quantitative problems to reach sound conclusions</li>
                <li>Communicates quantitative results appropriate to the problem or context</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>The book is written to be used in conjunction with active learning pedagogies. Each section introduces concepts providing a couple examples and then provides a self-grading exercise with feedback for the reader to test comprehension of the concept. Videos where included are presentations of the introduction of the concept. Homework by default is live, online problems that provide feedback. The scores on these cannot be saved. Because this is implemented through MyOpenMath, that tool can be easily paired with the book. It is possible to produce a version of the text where the homework is not live.</p>
