<title>Representing Data</title>

<introduction>

<p>We often represent numerical data using diagrams. These include various kinds of charts like bar graphs and pie charts, and graphing of functions. We do this to make certain traits of the data easier to notice. Here we will look at how some of these are produced and begin to learn to recognize differences due to rates.</p>

		<title>Increasing Income</title>

		<statement><p>When Vasya was hired in 2017 she was paid an annual salary of $62,347.23. Her work has been good, so each year she has received raises of $5000.00.</p>
		<p>To represent this data we first need to calculate her salary each year. We calculate this by iteratively adding the $5000 for each year. This is found in <xref ref="table-graphing-bar1" /></p>
		<p>We will represent her salary over time using the bar graph in <xref ref="figure-graphing-bar1" />. Notice the horizontal axis is labeled with years and the vertical axis is labeled in dollars. There is one bar for each year, because her salary was changed only once each year.</p>
		<p><ul>
			<li>Does this graph tell us when Vasya received her raises each year?</li>
			<li>If we made the horizontal axes dollars and the vertical axis years, would this change the information presented? Would it be easier or harder to read?</li>

	<title>Graphing Continuous Data</title>

	<p>Because the salaries changed only once per year we could use a single entry each year. For other data the changes occur constantly.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-vary-continuous">
		<title>Scale Model</title>

		<statement><p>A model of a space shuttle is 1:144. This means one inch on the model represents 144 inches on the actual shuttle. Similarly 2 inches on the model represents 288 inches on the actual shuttle. Lengths are not just integers, we could have a part that is 1.72 inches. This would be <m>1.72 \cdot 144 = 247.68</m> inches on the actual shuttle.</p>
		<p>To represent the conversion from inches on the model to inches on the actual object we need to plot points and connect them continuously. A graph of this in <xref ref="figure-graphing-line1" />. Notice the two points and the extension of those.</p>
		<p>Why does the graph start at 0?</p>

		<title>Ohm's Law</title>

		<statement><p>Ohm's Law relates three properties of electricity: voltage, current, and resistance. <term>Voltage</term>, measured in volts (V), is analagous to the amount of pressure to move the electrons. <term>Current</term>, measured in amperes (amps), is how much electricity is moving. <term>Resistance</term> measured in Ohms (<m>\Omega</m>), is, as it sounds, the resitance of a material to letting electricity flow.</p>
		<p>The relationship is <me>V = IR</me> where <m>V</m> is voltage, <m>I</m> is current, and <m>R</m> is the resistance.</p>
		<p>Consider a 12 V system with an 8 Ohm resistor.
			<md>
				<mrow>12 = &amp; I \cdot 8. </mrow>
				<mrow>\frac{12}{8} = &amp; I. </mrow>
				<mrow>1.5 = &amp; I.</mrow>
			</md>
			If we reduce the resistance to 4 Ohms we get
			<md>
				<mrow>12 = &amp; I \cdot 4. </mrow>
				<mrow>\frac{12}{4} = &amp; I. </mrow>
				<mrow>3 = &amp; I.</mrow>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-linear-notation">
	<title>Representing Linear Relations</title>

	<p>We have seen what linear data looks like in data tables, discrete graphs (e.g., bar graph), and continuous graphs. Here we will add a representation in mathematical symbols that are useful for calculation.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-graphing-linear-equation">
		<title>Equation for Vasya</title>

		<statement><p>Remember from <xref ref="example-graphing-bar1" /> that Vasya's annual salary follows a linear pattern. Specifically it increases $5000.00 per year. That means in over one year it has increased $5000.00. Over two years it has increased
		<md>
			<mrow>\$5000.00 + \$5000.00 &amp; =</mrow>
			<mrow>2 \cdot \$5000.00 &amp; = \$10,000.00.</mrow>
		</md>
		Over three years it has increased
		<md>
			<mrow>\$5000.00 + \$5000.00 + \$5000.00 &amp; =</mrow>
			<mrow>3 \cdot \$5000.00 &amp; = \$15,000.00.</mrow>
		</md>
		Generally then we can say that after <m>n</m> years, Vasya's salary has increased <m>5000n</m> dollars. To know her actual salary we need to add her initial salary. An equation for Vasya's salary then is <me>S = \$62,347.23 + \$5000.00 n</me>.</p></statement>
	</example>

	<exercise xml:id="exercise-graphing-linear-slope">
		<webwork>
			<statement>
				<p>If Dimitri's salary is given by the equation <me>S = \$73,240.00 + \$6000.00 n</me> where <m>n</m> is the year of employement, what was his initial salary? <var name="'73240'" width="7" /></p>

	<p>In <xref ref="example-vary-continuous" /> we graphed a line. In terms of the graph of a line, the rate of change is known as the <term>slope</term>. Because the rate of change is constant, the slope can be calculated from any two points.</p>

	<p>Note a rate is a ratio of changes. In terms of points expressed in Cartesian coordinates the calculation is <me>\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</me>. This is read, <q>change in y divided by change in x.</q></p>

	<example xml:id="example-calculate-slope">
		<title>Calculate Slope</title>

		<statement><p>The graph in <xref ref="figure-graph-slope" /> is linear. We will calculate the slope twice.</p></statement>
		<solution><p>We will use the points (4000,33.94) and (2000,31.94).
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{33.94-31.94}{4000-2000} &amp; = \frac{2}{2000}</mrow>
				<mrow> &amp; = \frac{1}{1000}.</mrow>
			</md>
			This means the slope is 1 inHg (inch of mercury) per 1000 feet above mean sea level.</p></solution>
		<solution><p>We will use the points (8000,37.94) and (4000,33.94).
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{37.94-33.94}{8000-4000} &amp; = \frac{4}{4000}</mrow>
				<mrow> &amp; = \frac{1}{1000}.</mrow>
			</md>
			As expected this is the same slope, because on a line the rate of change (slope) is constant.</p></solution>

			<statement>
				<p>Suppose that as dry air rose it dropped in temperature in a linear fashion. If the temperature was measured at 1000 ft MSL as <m>21^\circ</m> C and at 3000 ft MSL as <m>17^\circ</m> C, what is the rate of change of temperature with respect to altitude? <var name="'-1/500'" width="4" /></p>
				<p>What does this imply the temperature is at 0 ft MSL? <var name="'23'" width="4" /></p>
			</statement>
			<solution><p>The slope can be calculated as <me>\frac{17-21}{3000-1000} = \frac{-4}{2000} = -\frac{2}{1000}</me>.</p>
			<p>Alternately because the temperature drops as the air rises, the temperature at a lower altitude (0 is lower than 1000) will be higher by 2 degrees. So the temperature is <m>21+2=23</m>.</p></solution>
