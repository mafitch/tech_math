	<p>We often represent numerical data using tables, diagrams, and graphs. These include various kinds of charts like bar graphs and pie charts, and graphs of functions. We do this to make certain traits of the data easier to notice. Here we will look at how some of these are produced and begin to learn to recognize differences due to rates. More details about rates will be covered in <xref ref="section-rates" />. </p>

	<title>Reading Tables of Data</title>

	<p>This section illustrates how some data can be stored in tables, how to read data from a table, and how to infer additional data when reasonable.</p>

	<p>Tables are useful if we have a limited number of entries, and the data can be indexed by two traits. The two traits become headers for the rows and columns. Note by limited number of entries we mean that the table can be easily used. If the table has more entries than we can see on a page or screen, it becomes less easy to use. Technology can make it easier to find the desired row and column such as a spreadsheet with the row and column headings frozen.</p>

	<table xml:id="table-table-stall">
		<title>Stall speed at 2550 lbs, most rearward center of gravity, speeds KIAS</title>
		<tabular top="major">
			<row halign="center" bottom="medium" left="major"><cell></cell><cell colspan="4" right="major">Angle of Bank</cell></row>

		</tabular>
	</table>

	<p>We do not need to understand what bank, flap, and stall speed mean to read this table. Indeed a table can be presented precisely to help explain what terms mean. However, to satisfy your curiosity note that stall speed refers to the speed at which a wing will produce insufficient lift to keep a plane flying. Falling beneath this speed typically results in the plane lowering its nose to regain speed. Angle of bank refers to how steeply the plane is tipped (left or right) in order to turn. KIAS stands for knots indicated air speed. Indicated airspeed is a speed pilots can see (think speedometer). Flaps are a structure extended for landing and sometimes take-off. Up means they are not in use. Approach and landing refer to varying degrees of extension.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-table-read-direct">
		<p>What is the stall speed in a 30<degree/> bank angle with flaps up?</p>
		<p>We can determine this by looking for the column labeled <q>30<degree/></q> and the row labeled <q>Up</q>. In that cell is the number 52. Thus the stall speed at that bank angle with flaps up is 52 KIAS.</p>
	</example>

	<example xml:id="example-table-read-find">
		<p>In what condition is the stall speed the highest?</p>
		<p>If we read all three rows, the largest number we find is 68. That is in the Up row and 60<degree/> column. So the stall speed is highest in the steep, 60<degree/> turn with the flaps in the up position.</p>
		<p>Note, there is no shortcut here for checking the entry in every row and column.</p>
	</example>

	<example xml:id="example-table-read-pattern">
		<statement>
			<p>As the angle of bank increases (from 0<degree/> to 60<degree/>) what happens to the stall speed?</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>If we look in the Up row, the stall speed changes from 48 to 52 to 57 to 68. The first thing we notice is that the stall speed increases.</p>
			<p>If we repeat this in the Approach row, we again see the speeds are increasing. The same is true in the Landing row.</p>
			<p>Thus we can say that stall speed increases as the angle of bank increases.</p>
			<p>In later sections (<xref ref="section-rates" /> ) we will learn to be more specific about patterns when possible.</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<exercise xml:id="exercise-table-read-direct">
<!--		<webwork>
			<statement>
				<p>What is the stall speed at <m>60^\circ</m> bank angle and <m>10^\circ</m> flap setting? <var name="'61'" width="4" /> KIAS</p>
			</statement>
	    </webwork> -->
	    <myopenmath problem="1457060" />
	</exercise>

	<p>Sometimes we want to know data that is between entries in a table. We can estimate these values if we know or can safely assume some property about the data. Below we show interpolation based on linear data. Linear data is described in <xref ref="section-linear" /> and <xref ref="section-rates"/>.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-table-read-interpolate">
		<p>What is the stall speed in a 15<degree/> bank angle with flaps in the Approach setting?</p>
		<p>First, we note that there is no column for 15<degree/> bank angle. However we have 0<degree/> and 30<degree/>. 15<degree/> is half way between these two. For this chart it is reasonable to estimate our desired stall speed by calculating the number half way between those in the table.</p>
		<p>The two stall speeds are 43 and 46. The number in between (the average) is <m>(43+46)/2=44.5</m>. When considering stall speeds, it is safest to assume a higher stall speed, so we will round to 45 KIAS.</p>
	</example>

	<exercise xml:id="exercise-table-read-indirect">
<!--		<webwork>
			<statement>
				<p>What is the stall speed at <m>37.5^\circ</m> bank angle and full flap setting? <var name="'46'" width="4" /> KIAS</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>Note this bank angle is half way between <m>30^\circ</m> and <m>45^\circ</m>. We can average the entries for those bank angles. <me>\frac{43+48}{2}=45.5</me> We round up to 46 KIAS for safety.</p>

	<title>Reading Graphs</title>

	<p>This section illustrates how some data can be represented in graphs and how to read data from a graph including some comparisons of graphs.</p>

	<p>Graphs that are curves (like lines) are read by finding a vertical heading that matches our question (think row) and read the corresponding horizontal heading (think column). Note this could be reversed, that is, find a horizontal heading that matches and read the corresponding vertical one.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-read-graph-glide">
		<p>If the plane with maximum engine out glide represented in <xref ref="figure-maximum-glide" /> is 2400 ft above the ground how many nautical miles can it glide forward?</p>
		<p>First we note that 2400 ft matches the vertical axis. We want to find the line across the graph that represents 2400 ft. Note, no line is labeled 2400, but we do have 2000 and 4000 and there are lines between them. To figure out which of these lines we should use, we must figure out how many feet each minor line represents.</p>
		<p>Counting we find 10 minor lines between each major line. Because each major line represents 2000 ft, we know the minor lines represent <m>2000/10=200</m> ft.</p>
		<p>Because <m>2400=2000+2(200)</m> we want the second minor line above 2000. We follow that to the blue line, then we follow the gray (minor) line down to the bottom. Our result is two minor lines before 4.</p>
		<p>We must figure out how much each minor vertical line represents. Each vertical major line is 2 nm. Again there are 10 minor lines between each major line, so we know the minor lines represent <m>2/10=0.2</m> nm.</p>
		<p>The glide distance for 2400 ft is therefore <m>4-2(0.2)=3.8</m> nm. We subtracted here because it is before 4.</p>
	</example>

	<figure xml:id="figure-maximum-glide">

		<image source="images/MaximumGlide" width="80%" />
	</figure>

	<exercise xml:id="exercise-table-read-graph">
<!--		<webwork>
			<statement>
				<p>What is the maximum glide for an aircraft 5000 above the ground? <var name="'8.2'" width="4" /> nm</p>
			</statement>
	    </webwork> -->
	    <myopenmath problem="1457191" />
	</exercise>

	<p>When we look at any table, graph, or figure we should ask ourselves why various choices were made. We may need to ask someone with related knowledge for an explanation.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-critical-graph-glide">
		<p>Consider <xref ref="figure-maximum-glide" />. The input we use is <q>Height Above Ground (ft)</q>. Frequently we place the inputs on the x-axis. Why was the y-axis chosen for the inputs here?</p>
		<p>Consider that the inputs are <em>heights</em>. This is a y-axis concept, so it matches our expectations. Reading the graph is not affected by this choice.</p>
		<p>Why do the inputs begin at 0 and end at 12000?</p>
		<p>They begin at 0, because we are talking about a plane gliding to the ground. A plane must be above the ground (above 0) to glide.</p>
		<p>They end at 12000 in this case, because this aircraft cannot fly higher than that altitude. We do not need data for cases that cannot occur.</p>
		<p>Why are the inputs labeled every 2000 and the inputs every 2?</p>
		<p>This is purely space available. If we put in more labels they would overlap each other.</p>
	</example>

	<p>Graphs can be from raw data which may appear random. We still read these graphs the same way.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-read-graph-temp-dewpoint">
		<p><xref ref="figure-temp-dewpoint" /> has the temperature and dewpoint read by a radiosonde (instruments on weather balloon) as it rose in the atmosphere. Note the vertical axis is the pressure reading. This is not the same as altitude, but it does correspond mostly to altitude. Dew point is the temperature at which water will condense, so it is also a temperature.</p>
		<p>What are the temperature and dewpoint at the 700 millibar level?</p>
		<p>We follow the 700 mb line over to the dewpoint (green, dashed) line. It is not quite halfway between -20<degree/> C and 0<degree/>. We estimate -7<degree/> C. Continuing across the 700 mb line to the temperature (red, solid) line we find it a little closer to 0<degree/>. We estimate the temperature is 5<degree/> C.</p>
	</example>

	<figure xml:id="figure-temp-dewpoint">
		<caption>Graph of Temperature and Dewpoint</caption>
		<image source="images/TempDewpointPANC" width="80%" />
	</figure>

	<p>Note some charts like <xref ref="figure-temp-dewpoint" /> are not meant to convey specific numbers but rather to show trends.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-read-graph-clouds-form">
		<p>Notice that while the temperature (red, solid line) wiggles around, it trends down as the pressure decreases. That is temperature decreases as altitude increases. We expect this, because it is farther from the ground which heats the air.</p>
		<p>Clouds form when the temperature reaches the dewpoint and the air is saturated (has enough moisture). We see in <xref ref="figure-temp-dewpoint" /> three places where temperature and dewpoint are the same. The lowest is between 800 and 700 millibars (we estimate 750 millibars). The second is between 700 and 600 millibars (we estimate 650 millibars). The third is at about 500 millibars. We would expect clouds to form at these altitudes.</p>
	</example>

	<example xml:id="example-critical-graph-radiosonde">
		<p>Consider <xref ref="figure-temp-dewpoint" />. The input we use is <q>Pressure (millibars)</q>. Why was the y-axis chosen for the inputs here?</p>
		<p>The pressure readings correspond to altitudes (height) which we tend to think of as up. Putting this on the y-axis matches this expectation.</p>
		<p>Why do the y-axis labels decrease as they go up?</p>
		<p>Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, so low pressure means higher altitude. The pressure readings are arranged to be low altitude at the bottom and high altitude at the top.</p>
		<p>Why do the inputs begin at 1000?</p>
		<p>Because the pressure readings correspond to altitude the highest pressure should be on the ground. It turns out 1013 is a typical pressure at ground level, so much higher pressure readings are not expected.</p>
		<p>Why are the output labels from -100 to 40?</p>
		<p>These are based on commonly experienced temperatures. Temperatures lower than -100<degree/> C are not expected. Temperatures above 40<degree/> C do occur, but not in the location where this sounding was taken.</p>
		<p>Use <xref ref="example-linear-model-temperature-conversion" /> to convert 50<degree/> C to Fahrenheit to see why this temperature is uncommon in most locations.</p>
	</example>

	<p>The input for the glide ratio questions is altitude. Altitudes are <term>continuous</term> that is it makes sense to refer to an altitude of 2453.27 feet (fractional feet). Similarly the pressure levels are continuous, that is it makes sense to refer to 501.7 millibar level. However, there is data where a fraction does not make sense. This <term>discrete</term> data is often graphed differently. The next examples illustrate a way of presenting discrete data.</p>

		<title>Increasing Income</title>

		<p>When Vasya was hired in 2017 she was paid an annual salary of $62,347.23. Her work has been good, so each year she has received raises of $5000.00.</p>
		<p>To represent this data we first need to calculate her salary each year. We do this by starting with her initial salary, then for each year adding the $5000 raise to the previous year's salary. This is an <term>iterative</term> process. <xref ref="table-salary-vasya" /> contains the results. Notice a table is a good means to represent discrete data.</p>
		<p>We will represent her salary over time using the bar graph in <xref ref="figure-read-graph-bar" />. Notice the horizontal axis is labeled with years and the vertical axis is labeled in dollars. There is one bar for each year, because her salary was changed only once each year. Bar graphs are a good option for discrete data.</p>
		<p>Consider the bar graph (ignore the table). Can you tell that Vasya's salary is increasing? Can you tell how much? How might the graph be changed to make information easier to find?</p>

	<title>Using Graphs to Analyze Models</title>

	<p>Above we practiced interpreting graphs provided for us. This section presents generating graphs to analyze and interpret models. While we will rely on technology to produce graphs, these examples begin with manual generation of graphs because that process helps us understand a model and it helps us understand what the graphs mean.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-scale-model">
		<title>Scale Model</title>

		<p>A model of a space shuttle is labeled as 1:144. This means one inch on the model represents 144 inches on the actual shuttle, that is, there is a ratio between the size of objects on the model and the size of the objects on the actual shuttle. If a portion of the model is 1.72 inches then means the part on the actual shuttle is <m>1.72 \cdot 144 = 247.68</m> inches. In general <m>A = 144M</m> where <m>M</m> is the size on the model and <m>A</m> is the size on the actual shuttle.</p>
		<p>To represent this scale conversion as a graph we will generate a table like <xref ref="table-salary-vasya"/> then we will use that to plot the graph.</p>
		<tabular>
			<row><cell>Model</cell> <cell>Full Size</cell> </row>
			<row><cell>1.0</cell> <cell>144</cell> </row>
			<row><cell>1.5</cell> <cell>216</cell> </row>

			<row><cell>2.5</cell> <cell>360</cell> </row>
			<row><cell>3.0</cell> <cell>432</cell> </row>
		</tabular>
		<p>We sketch a graph by plotting the points first. Notice the five points based on the table above. Through the points we draw a curve: in this case it is a line. The graph is in <xref ref="figure-graphing-line1" />.</p>
		<p>For the curious, software uses this same process to produce a graph. It usually plots a much larger number of points and then connects the dots with short line segments.</p>
	</example>

	<example xml:id="example-analyze-scale-model">
		<p>Why does the graph start at 0? The inputs are lengths on the model; negative lengths do not make sense.</p>
		<p>Why does it end at 4? If we wanted all sizes from zero to the largest dimension of the shuttle, we would need a bigger graph. However, because this is a line, we have a good idea what the rest of the graph looks like.</p>
		<p>This graph is a line. We knew it would be because <m>A = 144M</m> is in the form of a line (as shown in <xref ref="subsection-present-linear" />).</p>

	<title>Graphing Lines</title>

	<p>We have seen what linear data looks like in data tables, discrete graphs (e.g., bar graph), and continuous graphs. This section addresses graphing lines from equations and analyzing linear models from graphs.</p>

	<p>As described in <xref ref="subsection-present-linear"/> a linear equation (model) can be written as <m>y=\frac{a}{b}x+c</m>. In <xref ref="example-scale-model" /> we graphed a linear equation. In that example <m>\frac{a}{b}=\frac{144}{1}</m> from the scaling factor and <m>b=0</m> because the line was not shifted.</p>

	<p>When referencing a graph of a line, the rate of change is known as the <term>slope</term>. Often the slope is expressed as <m>\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}</m> because the denominator indicates how far horizontally along the graph we need to go for the graph to rise vertically the amount of the numerator. In the scale model example every one unit along the x-axis the line rises 144. The slope is 144/1 (rise/run).</p>

	<p>Because the rate of change is the fixed, the slope can be calculated from any two points. We can calculate the slope from points in a table or points from a graph using <me>\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</me>. This ratio is read, <q>change in y divided by change in x.</q></p>

		<statement><p>The graph in <xref ref="figure-graph-slope" /> is linear. We will calculate the slope twice.</p></statement>
		<solution><p>First, we will use the points (4000,33.94) and (2000,31.94).
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} &amp; = \frac{33.94-31.94}{4000-2000}</mrow>
				<mrow> &amp; = \frac{2}{2000}</mrow>
				<mrow> &amp; = \frac{1}{1000}.</mrow>
			</md>
			This means the slope is 1 inHg (inch of mercury) per 1000 feet above mean sea level.</p></solution>
		<solution><p>We will use the points (8000,37.94) and (4000,33.94).
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} &amp; = \frac{37.94-33.94}{8000-4000}</mrow>
				<mrow> &amp; = \frac{4}{4000}</mrow>
				<mrow> &amp; = \frac{1}{1000}.</mrow>
			</md>
			As expected this is the same slope, because on a line the rate of change (slope) is constant.</p></solution>

			<statement>
				<p>Suppose that as dry air rose its temperature dropped in a linear fashion. If the temperature was measured at 1000 ft MSL as <m>21^\circ</m> C and at 3000 ft MSL as <m>17^\circ</m> C, what is the rate of change of temperature with respect to altitude? <var name="'-1/500'" width="4" /></p>
				<p>What does this imply the temperature is at 0 ft MSL? <var name="'23'" width="4" /></p>
			</statement>
			<solution><p>The slope can be calculated as <me>\frac{17-21}{3000-1000} = \frac{-4}{2000} = -\frac{2}{1000}</me>.</p>
			<p>Alternately because the temperature drops as the air rises, the temperature at a lower altitude (0 is lower than 1000) will be higher by 2 degrees. So the temperature is <m>21+2=23</m>.</p></solution>
