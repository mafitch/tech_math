<title>Working with Applications</title>

<introduction>

<p>We are emphasizing using math to address questions that arise from various circumstances. This means the problems do not come with a model (think equation or function) and instructions on using it. In this section we will consider how we can go about using a description (typically verbal) to identify and use a model.</p>

</introduction>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-model-process">
	<title>Process Overview</title>

	<p>Our first task is to read the problem to understand it.
		<ul>
			<li><p>Read the problem description a few times. 
				<ul>
					<li>If you can paraphrase it, you understand it enough.</li>
					<li>Drawing a picture and labeling parts may help.</li>
				</ul></p></li>
			<li>Identify what we are asked to do.</li>
			<li>Identify the information we are given. Note distinctions like measurements and rates.</li>
			<li>Identify any units. These often help us set up a model.</li>
			<li>Write everything! We do not model in our heads.</li>
		</ul></p>

	<p>Next we write the mathematical model (equation or function).
		<ul>
			<li>Use the description to determine which application type (e.g., percent, proportion, linear model, etc.). Note units can suggest this (e.g., meters and meters squared indicate something was squared).</li>
			<li>Do not insert any numbers yet.</li>
			<li>Do not do any calculations yet.</li>
		</ul></p>

	<p>Now we will have a model that matches our situation and possibly some numbers to insert.
		<ul>
			<li>Insert numbers into the model. You may have to calculate some of these (e.g., you are given two points but not the slope you need).</li>
			<li>Solve for the desired value. Note it may help to do some calculations with the numbers first.</li>
			<li>State your answer and use units appropriately.</li>
		</ul></p>

	<p>Finally we should check that our answer makes sense. We should not have negative prices (usually) or distances larger than the earth (when working with terrestrial problems).</p>

	<example xml:id="example-model-rental-truck">
		<statement>
			<p>You moved across town and rented a 20 foot moving truck for the day. You want to make sure the bill you received is correct. If you paid $81.03, for how many miles were you charged? Assume there were no extra fees.</p>
			<image source="images/UHaul.png" />
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>We want to compare the bill we received to the price listed in the add. The question is about how many miles (not how much money).</p>
			<p>We are given the price per mile ($0.79 per mile). There is also a fixed cost for the rental ($39.95). Adding the fixed cost and the milage cost will give us the total.</p>
			<p>Our model is <m>C = \$39.95+\$0.79m</m> where <m>C</m> is the total cost and <m>m</m> is the number of miles.</p>
			<p>We know the total cost, which will leaves <m>m</m> in the equation, the number of miles, which is what we want to calculate. We can use the solving technique in <xref ref="section-linear" />
			<md>
				<mrow>\$81.03 &amp; = \$39.95+\$0.79m</mrow>
				<mrow>-\$39.95+\$81.03 &amp; = -\$39.95+\$39.95+\$0.79m</mrow>
				<mrow>\$41.08 &amp; = \$0.79m</mrow>
				<mrow>\frac{\$41.08}{\$0.79} &amp; = \frac{\$0.79}{\$0.79}m</mrow>
				<mrow>52 &amp; = m</mrow>
			</md>. The charge is for 52 miles.</p>
