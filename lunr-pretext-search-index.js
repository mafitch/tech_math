  "body": " For Faculty  This book is designed to be used for classes supporting trade programs in a variety of fields and also to satisfy baccalaureate general education requirements.  It is also written to be used in conjunction with active learning pedagogies rather than as a reference text. That is, it has been designed for students to read the examples, work initial problems to help them identify questions, and to then seek help while working on exercises. It can be easily incorporated into flipped classrooms and asynchronous learning. It intentionally does not provide an example to mimic for each question in the exercises. Rather each section provides an simple example, a more complex example, and some explanation about what is important. Then exercises are provided for them to test their ability to recognize and use the mathematics from that section.  The check points (exercises in the reading) are self-grading with feedback so the reader can determine what if any questions they need to ask. Videos, where included, are presentations of the introduction of the concept in that section. Homework by default is live, online problems that provide feedback. The scores on these cannot be saved in an LMS however. If you wish to use MyOpenMath, the problems, and even a shell, can be provided. If desired the PDF version can be used which does not have live homework.  The projects are an integral part of the general education goals. These are intended to be assigned after relevant material is covered. They require students to use topics from that chapter to perform calculations and then interpret the results of their work. The projects also provide a opportunity for students to express calculations using standard mathematical notation and to communicate mathematical results in clear language.  For context, here is a brief history. The first version of this text was written to transition to an OER for MATH A104 Technical Mathematics at the Univesity of Alaska Anchorage. Commercially available texts emphasized memorizing problem types with limited critical thinking. As such they could not be used to satisfy the general education requirement. There was also a desire to reduce costs including for textbooks and online homework systems. As a result this book was created with matching homework in MyOpenMath.  Served disciplines at UAA included auto\/diesel, heavy equipment mechanics, welding and non-destructive testing, aviation mechanics, piloting, air traffic controll, and medical certification programs.  The general education outcome around which this was designed was: Quantitative courses develop abilities to reason mathematically and analyze quantitative and qualitative data to reach sound conclusions for success in undergraduate study and professional life. The indicators were  Interprets info in mathematical form (equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words)  Represents and\/or converts relevant quant info and explain its assumptions and limits  Applies mathematical forms (equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words) to quantitative problems to reach sound conclusions  Communicates quantitative results appropriate to the problem or context    "

  "title": "Units",
  "body": " Units   This section addresses the following topics.  Interpret data in various formats and analyze mathematical models  Communicate results in mathematical notation and in language appropriate to the technical field  This section covers the following mathematical concepts.  Unit conversion (skill)  Setup and solve proportions (skill)    This book is designed to present mathematics in various contexts including a variety of trades. As a result numbers will frequently be connected to units such as length (feet, meters), time (seconds) or others. These units are part of the arithmetic, and so we must learn what they mean and how to perform this arithmetic. Sometimes the units even suggest to us how to setup the arithmetic.  In this section we will introduce the units so we can understand them when we read technical material ( ) and use them correctly to communicate results to others ( ). We will also learn to convert units ( ) which involves our first use of proportions ( ).  We measure many things such as distance, time, and weight. We describe these measurements in terms of units like miles, hours, and pounds. But have you ever stopped to think about how these units are defined?  The story of some of these units is lost in history. For example dividing the day into 24 units began with ancient Egyptians. They did not record, that we know of, the reason for choosing 24 units as opposed to 30 or any other number.  Other units, such as the metric (also called the International System of Units or simply SI) are much more modern. Initially many units were based on something physical. For example, one calorie is the amount of heat it takes to raise the temperature of one gram of water C. The meter was originally defined as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the north pole. The problem with this type of measurement is that it is neither fixed (depends on where on the equator your begin) nor easy to measure.  Thus modern definitions were developed. The length of a meter was changed to mean the length of a bar of metal kept in special storage in France. The bar had been carefully constructed and was used to confirm other measurement devices were correctly calibrated. It was changed yet again to be based on wavelengths of radiation. These are uniform no matter where they are done, so they can be used by many people to construct simple measurement tools.    Types of Measurement  First we will look at units for different types of measurement in the two major systems. In a specific trade you will need to memorize the units you use most often. For this class you should ask your instructor which units must be memorized and which you may look up when working on problems.  Note that the U.S. Customary system (related to the British Imperial system) is non-uniform, so there are multiple names for some types of measurements. This is in contrast to the SI (metric) which has one name for each property and prefixes to indicate the size. lists names of units for both systems. It is important to be able to recognize which unit (name) goes with which type of measurement (e.g., length, volume, ).   Units of Measure   Measuring US Customary Metric  Length inch (in) meter (m)  foot (ft)  yard (yd)  mile (mi)  nautical mile (nm)  Volume fluid ounce (oz) liter (L or )  cup (c)  pint (pt)  quart (qt)  gallon (g)  Weight ounce (oz) gram (g)  pound (lb)  Temperature degrees Fahrenheit (F) degrees Celsius (C)  Pressure inches of mercury (inHg) bar  pounds per square inch (psi) Pascal (Pa)  Time second (s)  minute (min)  hour (hr)    One name: two meanings Note that fluid ounces and weight ounces are not the same unit. Ten (10) fluid ounces of milk does not weigh ten (10) ounces. You must determine which ounce is referenced by the context. This can be tricky in recipes, which is a good reason to use SI units.  Note a gram is a unit of mass rather than than a unit of weight. Pound and ounce on the other hand are units of weight. Nevertheless gram is often used to describe weight because it is easy to switch between it and weight. Namely, mass can be obtained by dividing by the acceleration due to gravity (see a physics book for more information). The official unit for weight (a force) is a Newton, but we will not use that in this book.    U.S. Customary  Often we need to convert between units within the U.S. Customary system. This section provides the information needed for conversion and examples of performing them. It is an example of units suggesting how we setup the calculation.  Why would we need to convert units? This can occur because measurements were taken with different scales. For instance, we cannot add 3 inches to 2.2 feet without changing one to make the units match.  Why are there multiple units in the first place? There are different units for different scales (e.g., inches for small lengths and miles for long distances). This is a result of the U.S. Customary system being developed from the British Imperial system which was based on disparate measurements from multiple centuries ago (look up unit names in an etymological dictionary for fun). Converting between units therefore requires remembering special numbers for conversion. Most of these you likely know.   Converting within U.S. Customary   Measuring Unit 1 Unit 2  Length 1 nm 6076 ft  1 mi 5280 ft  1 yd 3 ft  1 ft 12 in  Area 1 acre 43,560  Volume 1 g 4 qts  1 qt 2 pts  1 pt 2 c  1 c 8 oz  Weight 1 ton 2000 lbs  1 lb 16 oz  Time 1 year 365 days  1 day 24 hrs  1 hr 60 mins  1 min 60 secs    Of course a year is not always the same number of days. It is important to know whether in a given circumstance we can use the common approximation of 365 days without injury or loss.  Review each of these examples to see how to convert from one U.S. Customary unit to another.   How many quarts is 2.3 gallons?  From we know (or can look up) that each gallon is 4 quarts. This means we have . This suggests that we can multiply 2.3 by this ratio, because the gallons will divide out.    How many cups is 1.7 gallons?   We do not have a number of cups per gallon. However, we can convert start by converting gallons to quarts. Then looking at the table again, we can convert quarts to pints, and finally we can convert pints to cups.  As with the previous example we can treat each conversion as a ratio of units. We setup the units so that multiplying will result in units dividing out.     How many days is 17 hours?   Here we are going from a small unit (hours) to a bigger one (days). This does not change our process. We can still multiply the amount by the unit conversion. Because we want to end up with days we use      Check that you can perform a unit conversion using this Checkpoint.     Metric (SI)  Just as with U.S. Customary units we often need to convert between SI units. This section provides the information needed for conversion and examples of performing them. It is an example of units suggesting how we setup the calculation.  Rather than have different names for different scales, metric uses one name of the unit (e.g., liter) and then uses prefixes to indicate size. These can be converted easily, because each prefix is a power of ten (uniform).  You will need to memorize a few of the prefixes. As with units which ones depends on your work. Ask your instructor which prefixes you should memorize for this course.   Metric Prefixes   Multiple Prefix  tera (T)  giga (G)  mega (M)  kilo (k)  hecto (h)  deka (da)  deci (d)  centi (c)  milli (m)  micro ( )  nano (n)  pico (p)    Review each of these examples to see how to convert from one SI unit to another.   How many centimeters is 3.8 meters?   From we know one centimeter is meters, that is, . This suggests that we can multiply 3.8 by the ratio which will cause the meters units to divide out. Note, because this is a power of ten ( ) the result is shifting the decimal place two positions. 3.8 meters becomes 380 centimeters.  Using this idea we can convert 0.76 meters to 76 centimeters by just shifting the decimal (no additional process necessary).     How many kilotons is 2.3 megatons?  We know one kiloton is tons and one megaton is tons. These are three powers apart ( ), which means we shift the decimal position three places. Because we are converting from a large unit to a smaller unit, we move the decimal place to the right (make the number bigger). 2.3 megatons is 2,300 kilotons.    How many centiliters is 13.6 milliliters?  We know one centiliter is liters and one milliliter is liters. This means we shift the decimal position. Because we are moving from a smaller unit to a larger unit, we move the decimal place to the left (make the number smaller). 13.6 milliliters is 1.36 centiliters.      Converting between Systems  Commonly we end up with measurements in both U.S. Standard system and SI. We will need to convert all units to one system before using them together. This process is the same as converting one Standard unit to another (e.g., converting miles to feet). This section provides the information needed for conversion and examples of performing them. It is an example of units suggesting how we setup the calculation.   U.S. Customary to SI   Measuring Standard SI  Length 1 nm 1.852 km  Length 1 mi 1.609344 km  1 ft 0.3048 m  1 in 2.54 cm  Volume 1 gal 3.785412 L  1 oz 29.573532 mL  Weight 1 lb 0.453592 kg  1 oz 28.349523 g     SI to U.S. Customary   Measuring SI Standard  Length 1 km 0.621371 mi  1 m 3.280840 ft  1 cm 0.393701 in  Volume 1 L 0.264172 gal  1 mL 0.033814 oz  Weight 1 kg 2.204623 lb  1 g 0.035274 oz    Review each of these examples to see how to convert between U.S. Customary units and SI units.   How many kilometers is 26.2 miles?  From we know each mile is 1.609344 km; this means there is . The ratio suggests that we can multiply 23.6 miles by the ratio, because the miles will divide out.    How many inches is 15 centimeters?  From we know each centimeter is 0.393701 inches; this means there is . The ratio suggests that we can multiply 15 centimeters by the ratio, because the centimeters will divide out.    How many inches is 1 meter?   From we know each meter is 3.280840 feet. From that each foot is 12 inches. We use the method of setting up a product of ratios so that the units divide out. We start with meters, so the first ratio must be feet per meters. We want to end with inches so the second ratio must be inches per feet.       Converting Compound Units  Some units, such as speeds, are compound. For example speed is distance per time. This section provides examples of converting compound units.   How many meters per second is 15 miles per hour?   We start with . We can convert miles to feet and feet to meters (multi-step conversion like ). The conversion ratios suggest we can multiply the 15 mi\/hr by the conversion ratios. We can use the same method (multiplying by conversion ratios to divide out units) to also conver hours to seconds. .  Note, we could perform that conversion in on step by multiplying all the conversion ratios at once.     How many pounds does a tablespoon of water weigh? Note that one gallon of water weights 8 lbs. Also a tablespoon is a half fluid ounce.   We need to conver the gallons into tablespoons. Because conversions are ratios, we multiply 8 lbs by the necessary conversions. .     Another kind of compound unit is square units such as square feet or seconds squared. When converting these we must account for the square.   Convert 2 acres to units of square miles.   First we note that an acre is . From we know that there are 5280 ft per mile. These conversion ratios suggest that we can multiply the 2 acres by the ratios to obtain the result in square miles.  It is not necessary to write all of the steps above if you understand how the final conversion line is obtained. The steps are included here to show how the squares show up in the final conversion.

  "title": "Accuracy and Precision",
  "body": " Accuracy and Precision   This section addresses the following topics.  Interpret data in various formats and analyze mathematical models  Communicate results in mathematical notation and in language appropriate to the technical field  This section covers the following mathematical concepts.  Rounding (skill)  Significant Figures (skill)  Determining appropriate rounding from context (critical thinking)    While calculating devices will produce a lot of decimal places, these are not always meaningful nor useful. This section presents different purposes for rounding numbers, examples of using each one, and examples of interpreting numbers we consume in work and life.  First, we will consider what lots of decimal places do and do not mean which will lead to definitions, then we will present a method for reasonably tracking precision, then consider other motivations and matching methods for rounding, and later consider the importance of managing error.    Explanation  When working with measurements, we care about the reasonableness of the results. Suppose four people measure the length of a piece of wood and come up with 1.235 m, 1.236 m, 1.237 m, and 1.234 m. We might conclude that we are confident it is 1.23 m long but we are not certain about the millimeters position. This leads to the concepts of accuracy and precision.   Accuracy  The accuracy of a measurement is how close the measurement is to the actual value.    If the board referenced above is actually 1.2364 m long then all four measurements are accurate to the second decimal place. The second measurement (1.236 m) is accurate to the third decimal place.    Note is an approximation for . Because to six decimals places (not rounded) is 3.141592, this approximation is accurate to only 2 decimal places.  Note, is not a measurement, rather it is defined theoretically. Thus we can produce an approximation that is as accurate as we have time and will to do. If curious, ask the nearest calculus instructor for details.   Note, if we are measuring something, it is because it is not possible to know the actual value. In the example of measuring the board all we can do is use measuring tools and all such tools have a margin of error. The actual length of the board is a mystery. Because of this we cannot determine the exact value of many kinds of data nor determine how accurate our measurement is. Instead we will settle for repeatability. If we get the same result often enough, we can convince ourselves that it is accurate.   Error  The error of a measurement is the difference between the reported measurement and the actual value.    The number of people at an outdoor concert was 2453. If someone estimated that the number of people was 2500, then that estimate is accurate to 1000's place, but has an error of only .    Precision  The precision of a measurement is the size of the smallest unit in it.   Note we can have high precision with low accuracy. That is, just because we write a lot of decimal places does not mean that number is close to the actual value of the measurement.   The answer to a homework question is 5.7632. If a response given is 5.7647 what are the precision and accuracy of the response?  Precision is effectively the number of decimal places. This is precise to 4 decimal places (the 10,000th position).  Because the response matches the actual value to the hundreds position, it is accurate to 2 decimal places.  Because , the error is 0.0015.    Introduction to Precision and Accuracy    How do we end up with measurements parts of which are not accurate? Consider the following.    When measuring the width of the blue, curved shape using the ruler (measurement in inches), it is clearly longer than 3\/4 and less than 7\/8 . The right side of the shape appears to be less than half way between 3\/4 and 7\/8 . Because it appears to be closer to 3\/4 , we can state the width is 3\/4 . Because the ruler does not have finer markings (e.g., 16ths or 32nds), we cannot be more precise.  We know this measurement is accurate to the nearest 1\/8 , because the ruler has those marked and, in this case, we can be confident it is closer to the left side.  To estimate the error we note that the right edge is less than half way between the markings. Half way would be 13\/16 or 1\/16 farther. Thus we can state that the shape is 3\/4 wide with an error that is less than 1\/16 .   While other tools for measurement can be more precise, every tool has a limit to its precision that is similar to this example. We should always be aware of the limitations of measurements when we use them.    Significant Figures  It makes no sense to write numbers that are more precise than they are accurate. For example writing 3.142857 (from the approximation ) for makes no sense, because it is only accurate to the hundreds position (3.14). It also makes no sense to perform arithmetic on digits that are not accurate. This section presents a reasonable way of tracking meaningful precision and rounding to maintain it. This will be used in most of the problems for the rest of the course.  When writing down measurements we need a way to indicate how precise the measurement is. Significant digits , also called significant figures or simply sig figs , are a way to do this.  The rules for writing numbers with significant digits have two parts: non-zero digits, and zero digits.  All non-zero digits are signficant.  Zeros between non-zeros are significant.  Any zeros written to the right of the decimal point are significant.  If zeros between non-zero digits (on left) and the decimal point (on right) are supposed to be significant, a line is drawn over top of the last significant digit.  For numbers less than 1, zeros between the decimal point (on left) and non-zero digits (on right) are not significant.  We can summarize these rules as: write only digits that you mean, and if it is ambiguous clarify.   Writing Significant Digits  Each of these numbers is written with five (5) significant digits.           We also need rules for arithmetic with significant digits. These are based on two principles  A result of arithmetic cannot be more precise than the least precise measurement.  The number of significant digits cannot increase.   For addition and subtraction the result (sum or difference) has the same precision as the least precise number added or subtracted. After adding or subtracting we round to the farthest left, last significant digit.   Subtraction with Significant Digits  . This is because the last significant digit of is the 10's position (with the 5 in it) whereas the last significant digit of is the 1's position (with the 3 in it). We do not know the 1's position of 11050, so we cannot know the 1's position in the result.    Addition with Significant Digits  . This is because the farthest left, last significant digit is in the 100's position in 202200. The extra precision of the other two numbers is not useful.   The significant digits addition\/subtraction rule basically says that adding precise data to imprecise data does not increase the precision of the imprecise data. For those who are curious an explanation of why this rule works is in this video.    For multiplication and division the result (product or quotient) has the same number of significant digits as the least number of the input numbers.   Division with Significant Digits  . This is because has only 3 significant digits.    Multiplication with Significant Digits  . This is because has only two significant digits.   The significant digit multiplication\/division rule basically says that digits that were multiplied by imprecise data cannot be precise. For those who are curious an explanation of why this rule works is in this video.    The rounding for significant digit rules is applied at the end of a calculation. That is if we have a mix of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division then we do all of the operations, track the significant digits that should apply for each operation and apply the rounding at the end.   Multi-Step Arithmetic with Significant Digits  Consider By order of operations we first calculate . Note that the result 19.13 is significant only to the first decimal place. Second by order of operations we calculate . This is the product of a number with 2 significant digits and one with 3 significant digits so the result should have only 2 significant digits which would be the 10's place. The last calculation is . 11,728 is significant to the one's place but the 746.07 is only significant to the 10's place. As a result the final result is rounded to the 10's place so    Calculate Note the is an exact number here. The rest are measurements in centimeters.      Rounding  Significant digits uses rounding to remove non-useful precision. This section presents various motivations for rounding and types of rounding and motivations for each.   Reasons for Rounding   Reality Constraints For example we cannot buy partial packages or have fractional people  Remove Detail For example when describing the population of a nation  Control Error When used in significant digits    The reason for rounding determines how we do it. Consider the following reality constraints requiring rounding. For example if we need 21 eggs and eggs are sold in cartons of one dozen (12) eggs, we need cartons. Since we cannot purchase part of a carton, we must round 1.75 up to 2, and purchase 2 cartons.  Note in this example reality requires us to round up to the nearest integer. We round to an integer because we cannot purchase fractional cartons of eggs. We had to round up, because rounding down would leave us with insufficient eggs (and we are hungry).  Suppose you have a bank account containing $11410 that accrues 1.65% interest. The bank calculates the payment should be . The bank will pay you $188.26. They round to the nearest one hundredth because cents is a unit which can be paid. They round down, because they like paying less.  For removal of detail consider reporting the population of a country. We might report the population as over 9 million rather than 9,904,607. There are multiple motivations for this rounding. Note the population is likely changing multiple times per day, so more precision in the number does not equal more accuracy. Also, because of the scale (millions) the detail about how many ones, tens, hundred, and thousands looses meaning.  When reporting on salary ranges we might report a range between $60,000 and $80,000. That the range is actually $61,233.57 and $80,290.11 is unlikely to change a decision. The applicant will ask about the exact salary after deciding the position is a good fit. A common usage of removing detail is when we care about the scale of things rather than the count.  Rounding to control error is the use of significant digits.  Before considering context, we will practice rounding numbers. Note we can round to any digit. We can round up, down, or to the nearest number (what is meant by round if neither up nor down are specified). Context or instructions will specify which digit and which type of rounding.   Rounding Up\/Down  Round 72481 down to the nearest hundred. 72400 is rounding down: we leave the 4 (hundred position) alone and truncate (turn to 0) all digits to the right. Note .  Round 72481 up to the nearest hundred. 72500 is rounding up: we increase the 4 to a 5 and truncate (turn to 0) all digits to the right. Note .  Round 72481 the nearest hundred. Because 72481 is closer to 72500 than it is to 72400, we round to 72500. We can recognize that we should round up because the tens position is which means rounding up results in a closer number. We could also recognize the need to round up by calculating and and noticing that (round up is closer).    Rounding Up\/Down  Round 72481 down to the nearest thousand. 72000 is rounding down: we leave the 2 (thousands position) alone and truncate (turn to 0) all digits to the right. Note .  Round 72481 up to the nearest thousand. 73000 is rounding up: we increase the 2 to a 3 and truncate (turn to 0) all digits to the right. Note .  Round 72481 to the nearest thousand. Because 72481 is closer to 72000 than it is to 73000, we round to 72000. We can recognize that we should round up because the hundreds position is which makes it closer to go down. We could also recognize the need to round down by calculating and and noticing that .    Rounding to Different Precisions  Round 72321.83 to the specified precision.  Thousands: 72000  Ones:72322  Tenths: 72321.8      Next we need to consider when to use each type of rounding.   Some floors are covered in carpet tiles. These are squares of carpet that are tiled to cover a floor. Suppose the carpet tiles are square with side length 20 . If a room is 50 feet by 38 feet, how many carpet square do we need?  First lets figure out how many tiles will go across the 50 feet. Note 50 feet is . This will require laying tiles across.  Next, lets figure out how many tiles will go across the 38 feet. Note 38 feet is . This will require laying tiles across. For each 0.8 of a tile we must cut a tile leaving only 0.2 of a tile left. This is too small to use elsewhere. Thus for each of these we will use a whole tile resulting in needing 23 tiles across (rounding up to have enough).  Finally we can count the number of tiles which is tiles.  If you are wondering why we do not use four of the 0.2 parts of a tile to fill a space, it is because that would look bad. Also, with so many seams it is more likely to pull up.    Suppose you baked three (3) dozen cookies and are distributing them equally between 7 people. How many cookies does each person receive?  There are cookies. Each person can have cookies. Because cutting cookies into pieces is typically a bad idea, we must round this down to 5 cookies per person.  Curious minds want to know what happens with the rest of the cookies. Notice there will be cookies given away leaving just one cookie for the baker to enjoy.     Greatest Possible Error  We have acknowledged that measurements will always have error. We have considered ways to round that are practical for the circumstances. Part of this depends on controlling the error. This section presents how to calculate the maximum error (worst case scenario). Typically we use this to ensure that error will not cause problems.  Because our rule for rounding is digits 0-4 round down and digits 5-9 round up, rounding will always have a greatest possible error of 5 in the position to the right of the one rounded. Consider the following.   What is the greatest possible error if 130 was rounded to the nearest 10?   One possibility is that 130 was rounded down. Then the original number was one of 130, 131, 132, 133, or 134. 134 is the farthest away from 130 at .  The other possibility is that 130 was rounded up. Then the original number was one of 125, 126, 127, 128, or 129. 125 is the farthest away at .  Thus the greatest possible error was 5 from the case that 125 was rounded up.  Note in this solution we assumed the number rounded was an integer. However, if we allowed for 134.927 and 125.01 the result would be the same. the extra digits don't change the rounding.     What is the greatest possible error if 9.31 was rounded to the nearest hundredth?  The largest possible error is if 9.31 was rounded up from 9.305. Thus the greatest possible error is 5 one thousdandths.    What is the greatest possible error if 223 was rounded up to the nearest one?  223 could have been rounded up from 222.1. But it could also have been rounded up from 222.01 or anything else. Thus the greatest possible error is less than 1 ( ).   Notice we have to know what type of rounding was used. In most measurements (i.e., significant digits) standard rounding will be used. For example think about measuring on a ruler: if the object isn't exactly on one of the lines, you will choose the closest one. The closest one requires rounding.

Because the ruler does not have finer markings (e.g., 16ths or 32nds), we cannot be more precise.  We know this measurement is accurate to the nearest 1\/8 , because the ruler has those marked and, in this case, we can be confident it is closer to the left side.  To estimate the error we note that the right edge is less than half way between the markings. Half way would be 13\/16 or 1\/16 farther.

  "body": " Working with Applications   This section addresses the following topics.  Interpret data in various formats and analyze mathematical models  Read and use mathematical models in a technical document  This section covers the following mathematical concepts.  Solve linear , rational, quadratic, and exponential equations and formulas (skill)  Read and interpret models (critical thinking)  Use models including linear, quadratic, exponential\/logarithmic, and trigonometric (skill)    In life when we figure out processes at work or in science we often express the result in mathematical notation. This includes equations, functions, and other options. These are collectively known as models. They allow us to communicate what we know and calculate results as needed. To succeed in many jobs and to fully enjoy life we need to be proficient at reading and using models.  This section begins by presenting models and illustrating calculating some results from them. It progresses to solving equations (models) as a review of algebra skills. Finally we present tips on how to identify and use models arising in applications. These topics are continued with specific models in later sections.    Calculating Results using Models   Ohm's Law   Ohm's Law relates three properties of electricity: voltage, current, and resistance. Voltage , measured in volts (V), is analagous to the amount of pressure to move the electrons. Current , measured in amperes (amps), is how much electricity is moving. Resistance measured in Ohms ( ), is, as it sounds, the resistance of a material to letting electricity flow.  The relationship is where  is voltage,  is current, and  is the resistance.       If we know that the current is 3 amps and the resistance is 8 ohms then we can calculate Thus in this system there must be 24 volts.  If the current is increased to 6 amps on the 8 ohm circuit, then To double the amps, we would need to double the voltage.  Similarly if we know that the current is 1.7 amps and the resistance is 6 ohms, then we can calculate Thus in this system there must be 10.2 volts.     Lift Equation   Lift is the force that keeps aircraft in the air.The lift equation explains factors that control the strength of lift produced by an airfoil (think wing or propellor). The factors included are air density, surface area of the airfoil, the coefficient of lift, and velocity. Air density is the amount of air per volume; you may see this as highs and lows on a weather map. It is also related to pressurizing aircraft flying at high altitude. The coefficient of lift incorporates multiple factors that are part of the design of the airfoil and how it is in use during flight.  The lift equation is where  is the lift in units of lbs or Newtons)  is air density in units of slugs per cubic feet or kilograms per cubic meter  surface area in units of square feet or square meters  is the coefficient of lift which is unitless  is velocity in units of feet per second or meters per second       If we know that air density is 0.002378 slugs per cubic feet, surface area is 125 , , and velocity is 84.4 , we can calculate the lift. Under these circumstances this airfoil can lift 1650 lbs.  If the air density is reduced to 0.001988 slugs per cubic feet then the lift is This represents the same aircraft flying 6000 feet higher (hence lower air density). Notice that without changing other factors (like velocity), it can lift (hold in the air) lbs less.     Ideal Gas Law   The ideal gas law is a relationship between the volume, pressure, temperature, and number of molecules of an ideal gas. The relationship is where  is the pressure in units of atmospheres (atm) or Pascals (Pa)  is the volume in units of cubic feet or cubic meters  is the number of moles (number of molecules, see a chemistry text for details)  is a constant specific to each gas (e.g., oxygen and nitrogen have different ones) in units that match the other values  is the temperature in degrees Rankine or Kelvin (these are shifted versions of Fahrenheit and Celsius).   When the number of molecules remains fixed, such as in a closed container, this law can be used to produce the equation where  , , and are the initial pressure, volume, and temperature, and  , , and are the pressure, volume, and temperature at another time.   Note in both forms of the law the units can be other than those listed (especially different scale like centimeters rather than meters). However, they must always match including the constant which is looked up in reference books.  For rounding note 273 is part of the definition of the Kelvin temperature scale, so it has infinite precision. It will not have any affect on signficant digits calculations.     Suppose the initial conditions are , , and . Also and . We can calculate the new pressure.  This is a scientific calculation so the rounding is significant digits.  If instead , then we have the following.        Calculating Results Requiring Solving  The previous section illustrated calculating model results without solving. This section presents additional example requiring limited solving and finishes with solving before any values have been substituted.  It does not matter if the value we desire is by itself, we can solve using arithmetic.   Recall the model for lift . Suppose we know the weight of the aircraft ( lbs), the density of air ( ), wing surface area ( ), and velocity ( ). Noting that lift must equal weight, what must the coefficient of lift be?    The desired value from the model may be in a denominator. We can solve for this using multiplication and division.   Recall that under simplifying assumptions See for details. Suppose we know the initial conditions ( atm, , F) and also atm and . What must the new temperature ( ) be?   Note we use significant digits for rounding because this is a science model.   The previous examples solved for a variable in a model after substituting numbers for the other variables. The next examples illustrate solving first. Note this process is the same as solving after substituting (same algebra) though there may be more steps. We might wish to solve this way, so it is easier to use the model multiple times.   Solve the equation for . Note, this model is explained in .     Solve the lift equation for .   Notice that the steps are the same algebra as if there were numbers. Also we could divide by and we are not concerned with the square as part of solving for .   Solve the lift equation for .    Process Overview  Above we started with a model and were asked to do something with it. Normally we will start with a problem which does not identify a model to use. Very few problems you encounter in lifte come pre-labled with models. This section presents how to start with a problem and work to a solution by identifying the model first.  Our first task is to read the problem to understand it.  Read the problem description a few times.  If you can paraphrase it, you understand it enough.  Drawing a picture and labeling parts may help.   Identify what we are asked to do.  Identify the information we are given. Note distinctions like measurements and rates.  Identify any units. These often help us set up a model.  Write everything! We do not model in our heads.   Next we write the mathematical model (equation or function).  Use the description to determine which application type (e.g., percent, proportion, linear model, etc.). Note units can suggest this (e.g., meters and meters squared indicate something was squared).  Do not insert any numbers yet.  Do not do any calculations yet.   Now we will have a model that matches our situation and possibly some numbers to insert.  Insert numbers into the model. You may have to calculate some of these (e.g., you are given two points but not the slope you need).  Solve for the desired value. Note it may help to do some calculations with the numbers first.  State your answer and use units appropriately.   Finally we should check that our answer makes sense. We should not have negative prices (usually) or distances larger than the earth (when working with terrestrial problems).    You moved across town and rented a 20 foot moving truck for the day. You want to make sure the bill you received is correct. If you paid $81.03, for how many miles were you charged? Assume there were no extra fees.     We want to compare the bill we received to the price listed in the add. The question is about how many miles (not how much money).  We are given the price per mile ($0.79 per mile). There is also a fixed cost for the rental ($39.95). Adding the fixed cost and the milage cost will give us the total.  Our model is where is the total cost and is the number of miles.  We know the total cost, which will leaves in the equation, the number of miles, which is what we want to calculate. We can use the solving technique in  . The charge is for 52 miles.

The factors included are air density, surface area of the airfoil, the coefficient of lift, and velocity. Air density is the amount of air per volume; you may see this as highs and lows on a weather map. It is also related to pressurizing aircraft flying at high altitude. The coefficient of lift incorporates multiple factors that are part of the design of the airfoil and how it is in use during flight.  The lift equation is where  is the lift in units of lbs or Newtons)  is air density in units of slugs per cubic feet or kilograms per cubic meter  surface area in units of square feet or square meters  is the coefficient of lift which is unitless  is velocity in units of feet per second or meters per second    "

  "body": " Percents   This section addresses the following topics.  Interpret data in various formats and analyze mathematical models  Communicate results in mathematical notation and in language appropriate to the technical field  This section covers the following mathematical concepts.  Calculate Percentages (skill)  Understand and interpret percentages (critical thinking)    Percentages are an often convenient way to express the relative size of two quantities such as the number of people who like lemon meringue pie to the number of those who like pie.  We will learn how to calculate a percent ( , ), how to convert between percents and the numbers (also , ), how to describe growth in terms of percents ( , ), and how to recognize what a percent does and cannot tell us ( , ).    Calculating Percents   Percent  A percent is a ratio of part of something to the whole of that thing that is written as parts per hundred.    Calculate a Percent   In a class there are 34 students. Of them 21 are female. In this case female students is part of the whole (all students). Thus the percent is calculated as . This number says there are 61 hundreths (remembering our numbering system), so the percent is written as 61.76%.  Rounding to two (2) decimal places was chosen to illustrate how we convert a ratio in decimal form to a percent. If we were reporting this information we would most likely round to 62%. This would convey the same meaning because the difference between 61.76% and 62% for 34 people is less than one person.     Generally, we calculate a percent by    In the class there are 34 students. Of them 13 are male. The percent is calculated as   Now that we have presented two examples of calculating a percent from counts, use the check point below to test that you can setup and calculate one yourself.   Note in the first pair of examples we had a whole class of 34 students with 21 female and 13 male. Of course 21+13 = 34, that is the two parts add up to the whole. Because of this 61.76% + 38.24% = 100% as well.  Sometimes we are given the size of the whole and a percent, and we are interested in calculating how many are in the part.   In a class of 22 students, 18% are Alaska Native. How many students are Alaska Native?   We use the same setup as before, but we don't know the part yet.  Notice that 3.96 does not make sense as a result when counting people, so we expect that the correct result is 4. We can confirm this by checking that This suggests that the original 18% was rounded. Likely it was rounded to the ones position out of convenience.   We know that a percent is a number out of 100, so we can skip a step from the previous example.      Sometimes we know the size of a part and what percent it is of the whole. From this information we can calculate the size of the whole.   In a class 2 Alaska Native students make up 6.25% of the class. How many students are in the class?  Again we use the same setup, but we don't yet know the whole.     How to Use an Example: Percents  Consider the following question.  If the first chapter of a certain book is 18 pages long and makes up 2% of the book, how many pages does the entire book have?  Because we see 2% we recognize this as a percent problem. Without more information we can begin writing our steps. In the first step is writing the definition of percent. In the example 0.0625 is written on the right (in place of percent). In this problem we know the percent is 2, and we know that in a calculation we write the percent as a decimal. Thus our next step is In the next step in the example the entries for part and whole are entered. In this problem the 18 pages is stated as one chapter and is contrasted to the entire book. Thus the 18 is the part. As with the example, the whole is not known so we leave it as a variable. Finally in the example they solve for the variable. Note the steps of solving may vary depending on what we know, so rather than follow the rest of the example, we apply our algebra skills. For convenience we will write instead of whole . Thus we know the entire book has 900 pages.    In this next check point the terminology is different but something is still part of a whole and the amount can be calculated using the same approach as above.   This video covers the topics above.     Percent Increase\/Decrease  A common use of percents is to indicate how much something has increased (or decreased) from one time to the next.   In spring there were 22 students in a class. In the following fall there were 34 students in the same class. This was an increase of 34-22=12 students. We can calculate what percent the increase of 12 is with respect to the original (spring) class size of 22.    We say that the class size had a percent increase of 55%. Note this says the increase was 55% of the previous whole .  We can think of this in another way.    In spring there were 22 students in a class. In the following fall there were 34 students in the same class.  We calculate the percentage the fall class size is with respect to the spring class size.   Because the fall class size (in the role of part ) is greater than the spring class size (in the role of whole), the percent ends up being greater than 100%. For percent increase we should always expect a percent greater than 100%.  Because this is 55% greater than 100%, the percent increase was 55% over the previous semester.       What is the percent increase or decrease if enrollment in a class was 78 in fall and 38 in the following spring?    Because 38 is less than 78 this is a decrease. Similar to the percent increase we can calculate the decrease first and then calculate the percent. . Thus the percent decrease is .    As with the percent increase we can start by simply computing what percent the fall enrollment is with respect to the prior spring enrollment. The ratio is . Because the new enrollment is 49% of the previous enrollment the decrease is 100%-49%=51%.     This video covers percent increase topics.     Limitations  We use percents because they can make the difference in scale between two quantities clear to us. However presenting a percent by itself can be deceptive.   Which of the following do you suppose represents a greater reduction in students?   Percent reduction  Total  18%  495  1.85%  54  60%  5      Percent reduction  Total  Number reduced  18%  495  90  1.85%  54  1  60%  5  3   The 18% of 495 represents the largest number of students. The 60% is a higher percent, but because the total is so small it represents very few students. A percent is more useful if we also know the total number.  Did you calculate 89 for 18% of 495? Compare the following to see why both are reasonable responses. 89 is what percent of 495? 90 is what percent of 495?    While percent is defined a parts per one hundred, there are times when percents, sensibly, add to more than one hundred.   contains data from the 2020 U.S. Census. It contains the percent of the state population who checked the box for that race. Note the total is 149.4%. The reason is that a person can select more than one race. As a result a large number of people are counted more than once. Naturally the total is greater than 100 as a result.  When interpreting percents and data in general we should ask about the assumptions are before we draw conclusions.    Declared Race in Alaska   Race  Percent  Alaska Native\/Native American  21.9%  Native Hawaiian\/Pacific Islander  2.5%  Asian  8.4%  Black  40.8%  White  70.4%  Other  5.4%       Questions about the definition, terminology, and notation.

If the first chapter of a certain book is 18 pages long and makes up 2% of the book, how many pages does the entire book have?  Because we see 2% we recognize this as a percent problem. Without more information we can begin writing our steps. In the first step is writing the definition of percent. In the example 0.0625 is written on the right (in place of percent). In this problem we know the percent is 2, and we know that in a calculation we write the percent as a decimal. Thus our next step is In the next step in the example the entries for part and whole are entered. In this problem the 18 pages is stated as one chapter and is contrasted to the entire book. Thus the 18 is the part. As with the example, the whole is not known so we leave it as a variable. Finally in the example they solve for the variable. Note the steps of solving may vary depending on what we know, so rather than follow the rest of the example, we apply our algebra skills. For convenience we will write instead of whole . Thus we know the entire book has 900 pages.  "

  "body": " Mixtures   This section addresses the following topics.  Read and use mathematical models in a technical document  This section covers the following mathematical concepts.  Calculate Percentages (skill)  Understand and interpret percentages (critical thinking)    This section continues the topic of percents through a set of applications.  There are many situations where we desire to mix two or more substances together in precise ratio. These include mixing medicines in diluents (like water) and mixing ingredients in a recipe. This section presents how to calculate the ratio of substances after mixing multiple solutions, and the reverse problem how to calculate the amount of each solution to mix for a desired ratio of substances.    Calculate the Result   In some circumstances we know the concentrations of substances in multiple solutions and how much of each has been combined. From this we can calculate the concentration of substances in the resulting solution.    Mix Multiple Solutions   Suppose we have a container with a solution that is 22% sugar and the rest water and another container with a solution that is 16% sugar and the rest water. If we combine 150 g of the first solution and 250 g of the second solution, what is the percent of sugar in the resulting solution?  To calculate a percent we need the amount of the part and the total amount. We can calculate the total directly: . Note we know we can add these because both represented total amounts and they have the same units (g).  To calculate the part we need to know how much (rather than what percent) sugar was obtained from the two solutions. We can calculate that from the given percents and amounts. Thus the percent of sugar in the mixture is .      Suppose we have 11.3 lbs of 4140 steel which is a type of steel containing 40% carbon and 9.2 lbs of 4150 steel which contains 50% carbon. If we melt and mix these two metals, what is the resulting percent carbon?    To calculate a percent we need the amount of the part and the total amount. We can calculate the total directly: . Note we know we can add these because both represented total amounts and they have the same units (g).  To calculate the part we need to know how much (rather than what percent) carbon was obtained from the two metals. We can calculate that from the given percents and amounts. Thus the percent of carbon in the resulting metal is .  Note is used where rounding was needed for significant digits.       Dilute a Solution  This section presents a slight variation of the mixture calculation problem. In this case we are adding only diluent resulting in diluting the solution.  The next problem is producing a isopropyl alcohol with a lower concentration of alcohol than the original solution. We begin with 16.0 oz of a 91.0% isopropyl alcohol solution. The other ingredient is water.   Dilute Alcohol  Suppose we begin with 16.0 oz of a 91.0% isopropyl alcohol and add 4.00 oz of water to this mixture. What will the percent alcohol of the resulting solution be?  The percent alcohol is the amount of alcohol (part) divided by the total volume (whole). Only the original solution has alcohol so based on the meaning of percent the volume of alchol is . We are adding 4.00 oz total to the solution, thus the total volume is oz. The final percent alcohol is or 73.0%.   If we added more water would the percent alcohol be greater or less? Note that if we are using all of the alcohol solution, the amount of water we add determines the percent alcohol.      Producing a Desired Solution  In the previous section we calculated the result of mixing two solutions. In this section the goal is to figure out how much diluent to add to achieve a specific concentration. That is, the previous section calculated in this section we solve.   Calcluate Dilution   If we start with 16.0 oz of 91.0% alcohol solution, how much water do we add to get (at least) 25.0 oz of a 55.0% alcohol solution?  How much solution total does this produce? Note it will not necessarily be 25.0 oz.    This is a percent problem with the total alcohol unchanged and adding only some amount of water. We need to be such that where is the amount of alcohol. Notice we do not use the 25.0 oz at this time. We will address that at the end.  The amount of alcohol is ). Thus we setup  Note this means we end up with of new solution. If we had added less water to get exactly 25 oz we would have had a more concentrated solution. We have at least the 25 oz we need and it is the correct concentration, so this we have achieved our goal.  Also note that the percent alcohol is This is not exactly 55% because of the rounding in the calculations.

  "body": " Ratios   This section addresses the following topics.  Interpret data in various formats and analyze mathematical models  Read and use mathematical models in a technical document  This section covers the following mathematical concepts.  Setup and solve proportions (skill)    A ratio expresses a fixed relationship between two quantities. This section illustrates using ratios to calculate amounts subject to a ratio and presents how to recognize what a ratio does and cannot tell us. Note, percents are simply ratios scaled to parts per 100, that is, what we know about percents is applicable here.    Example Ratios   Simple syrup consists of one cup of sugar and one cup of water which is heated until the sugar is disolved. There are multiple ratios that express this combination. , ratio of sugar to water by weight, ratio of sugar to simple syrup.  Each of these ratios indicates that there is a fixed amount of sugar relative to the water or resulting syrup. That is, is if we made simple syrup with 2 cups of sugar we would need 2 cups of water because by reducing fractions.    In a neighborhood there are 7 dogs and 12 cats. To express the relative number dogs and cats we can write the ratio  Note that . Because it is less than one the ratio tells us that there are fewer dogs than cats in this neighborhood.  We could also write to express the exact same relationship. Note that . Because it is greater than one the ratio tells us that there are more cats than dogs in the neighborhood (same result as above).    Rates are expressed as ratios. The following rates are all written as ratios.  Notice that these (and most rates) are expressed with the denominator being one. This makes it easier to calculate as will be seen below. Frequently we will skip writing the one in the denominator, e.g., .  Rates are not required to have a denominator of one and sometimes a different denominator is easier for calculation. For example     Using Ratios  Just like percents (which are ratios written in decimal form) if we know a ratio and one of the amounts we can calculate the other amount. The method is the same as with percents, namely multiplying the correct number or solving an equation.   Ratio: Airspeed  The Diamond DA-20 cruises at the rate (speed) of . Cruise is a portion of flight in which the speed is typically constant. How far can the plane cruise in 2.5 hours?  The units suggest we can multiply these. . This works because we are multiplying by hours and dividing by hours which leaves us with nautical miles as desired.    Ratio: Airspeed by Table  There is another approach to the same question.  The Diamond DA-20 cruises at the rate (speed) of . Cruise is a portion of flight in which the speed is typically constant. How far can the plane cruise in 2.5 hours?  Because this ratio remains the same during cruise we can break the problem down into pieces. Based on the ratio (speed) in the first hour the plane will cruise 110 nm. In the second hour it will cruise another 110 nm. In the last half hour it will fly half of the distance which is nm. Thus in 2.5 hours it will cruise nm.  Some manuals provide tables to make this method convenient. See for a table of this sort. How far can the DA-20 cruise in 2.7 hours? We need to write 2.7 as the sum of numbers in the table. One way is . From the table we know it will cruise 220 nm in 2 hours, 55 nm in an additional 0.5 hours, and 22 nm in the final 0.2 hours. Thus it will cruise nm.  While this method makes sense, it takes more time than simply multiplying.    Airspeed and Distance   Time Distance  0.1 hour 11 nm  0.2 hour 22 nm  0.3 hour 33 nm  0.4 hour 44 nm  0.5 hour 55 nm  1 hour 110 nm  2 hour 220 nm  3 hour 330 nm     Water is flowing out of a hose at a rate of 11 gallons per minute. How many gallons have come out after 2.7 minutes?  We can set this up like the calculation in . In that example multiplied the ratio (nm\/hr) by the number of hours which gave us nm. Here we multiply the ratio (gal\/min) by the number of minutes which will give us gallons. Here we use significant digits because these are measurements.    Based on data from the FDA the average amount of mercury found in fresh or frozen salmon is 0.022 ppm (parts per million). This means there are 0.022 mg of mercury in one liter of salmon. If a meal portion of salmon is 0.0020 liters how much mercury is consumed?  We can use the ratio . We apply this ratio to the given volume of 0.0020 liters.     The method for ratios that have a number other than one in the denominator is the same.   A saline solution intended for nasal rinsing has a ratio of 2.5 g of salt (sodium chloride) per 240 mL of pure water. How much salt is needed to make a half liter of saline solution?  We can apply the given ratio (2.5 g\/240 mL) to the given amount (0.5 L). First it will be convenient to convert a half liter to milliliters. This is also a ratio problem. See for the conversion ratio. Next we can multiply the saline solution ratio by the volume. Note we use two significant digits because the measurements 2.5 and 240 both have two significant digits. The 500 is part of a definition so it has infinite significant digits.    At 90 nm\/hr a plane travels 3 nm\/2 min. How far will it travel in 6 minutes?  We can multiply the given ratio (nm\/hr) by the given amount (min) to calculate distance (nm).      Understanding Ratios  Like percents ratios tell us a relationship between two quantities but do not tell us how much. For example if a cookie recipe calls for 2 cups of milk for every 3 eggs, we do not know how many eggs are needed for a dozen cookies. We would also need to know either how many cups of milk per dozen or how many eggs per dozen.  Ratios may be based on rounded numbers. For example the unit convesion is convenient for quick calculations. However, which is a more accurate conversion rate. If we are trying to convert Tempo 30 (a speed limit of 30 kph) to mph this ratio is fine. If we are sending a satellite to another planet, we will need a more accurate conversion.  Rounding may occur to make the ratio easier to comprehend. For example according to an article by the U.S. Census Bureau 1 in 6 people in the U.S. was aged 65 and over. Because this ratio uses small numbers it is easy to understand. It is much easier to read and use than a more precise estimate of .                   Add some about interpreting ratios here.   "

  "body": " Proportions   This section addresses the following topics.  Interpret data in various formats and analyze mathematical models  Read and use mathematical models in a technical document  This section covers the following mathematical concepts.  Setup and solve proportions (skill)    When a ratio remains fixed, we can use it to solve for quantities. These are called proportions. This section presents a variety of problems in which this is useful and, indirectly, reviews the algebra needed to solve them.  Fixed ratios make sense in examples like conversion of units. For example 1 gallon is always 4 quarts. In contrast rates often change: your average speed may be 25 mph, but you must have driven slower and faster during that drive. For the ratios that do not change we can write equations and solve for properties.    Proportion Examples  Proportion problems start with a fixed ratio. Because it is fixed we can write ratio equals ratio. This gives us something to solve. There are multiple ways to solve these, each of which is demonstrated below.   The first example shows a straight forward proportion with the simplest solving method. This is like solving a percent problem.   Cheesecake Groceries: Double  For a particular cheesecake recipe there is g of eggs and g of cream cheese. We will determine how many grams of eggs we need if we double the recipe. This means everything will be in ratio of 2\/1.  The proportion is based on original recipe and doubled recipe. That is every ingredient will be doubled: we must perform the calculation for eggs and cream cheese separately. We want the ratio of number of eggs in the doubled recipe to the number of eggs in the original recipe to be 2\/1. Thus Because the quantity to solve is in the numerator we can simply multiply to isolate that quantity (variable).  Note because we are using measurements in grams (mass\/weight) we used significant figures for rounding. In commercial recipes (and quality home cooking), weights are used because items like eggs are not uniform in mass. If we always use 3 eggs it might be more or less than we need messing up the food. Also note the 2 and 1 have infinite significant figures (they are exact numbers rather than approximated measurements).   This example may seem overly simple because doubling is easy, but the arithmetic is the same for any scaling.   Guido needs 6 dozen cookies. A recipe makes 4 dozen. If that recipe calls for g of flour, how much flour does he need for the 6 dozen cookies?  First, we determine the ratio for scaling. We want 6 dozen and the recipe makes 4 dozen so our ratio is . Thus to determine the amount of flour needed we setup the proportion   This example shows methods for handling proportions when the desired quantity (variable) ends up in the denominator.   Cheesecake Groceries: Unknown  For a particular cheesecake recipe there is g of eggs and g of cream cheese. If we have g of egg how much cream cheese do we need? We know that the egg to cream cheese ratio must be 150\/1500. We notice . This means we need to solve  Because a ratio expresses the relationship between two quantities, it is not important which is numerator or denominator. Thus it is equally valid to write   This example shows an alternate way to solve for the desired quantity when it is in the denominator.   Proportion: Solving  According to the airplane flight manual a Diamond DA-20 cruises at the rate of .  How long will it take to travel 236 nm?  Because cruise speed is a fixed ratio we can write       Multiple Proportions  When we experience math in the wild, problems do not come labeled with solving methods. We must recognize the math and apply our knowledge appropriately. The next example illustrates identifying ratios (proportions) more than once when answering a question.   Suppose a Diamond DA-20 climbs at the rate of and across the ground during this climb. How far forward does the plane fly during a climb of 3500 feet?  Because we are told how far the plane climbs, we must use the rate of climb ratio first. As before we can calculate how long it will take to climb. .  Now that we know how long the plane flies during this climb we can use that with the ground speed ratio to calculate how far foward it flies. However, first we must convert the speed to feet per minute or the time to hours.  Finally we can use this rate and the time of climb to calculate the desired distance. If desired we can convert this to nautical miles which is    A recipe for hush puppies calls for 150 g of flour for 340 g of buttermilk. If we have 465 g of flour and 918 g of buttermilk, how much of the flour and buttermilk can we use? Which one constrains us (limits size of our batch)? Note quality kitchen scales are accurate to a single gram.  The ingredients must remain in the ratio . We can select either ingredient and see how much the ratio tells us we need of the other ingredient.  Suppose we use all 465 g of flour. Then we can setup the proportion Notice that this is more buttermilk than we have. That means the buttermilk is the limiting ingredient. We will be able to use all of the buttermilk, but only some of the flour. To determine how much we setup the proportion but this time solve for flour.  We will use all 918 g of buttermilk. Then we can setup the proportion Thus we can use all 918 g of buttermilk and 405 of the 465 g of flour. Note we have rounded everything to one gram because that is as accurate as we can measure with our scale. If a single recipe uses 340 g of buttermilk, then we will be making times as much.      Similar polygons   This section presents a geometric fact which is expressed as proportions. This geometry can be used to solve for distances or lengths in some circumstances. First we define and illustrate the geometric fact.    Explaining Similar Triangles   Similar Triangles  Two triangles are similar if and only if corresponding angles are the same.   When triangles are similiar their corresponding side lengths are proportional. Corresponding sides are the sides from both triangles that are across from an angle of the same measure. This is illustrated in the following example.    The triangles and are similar. Notice that the angles at and are the same measure as are the angles at and and the angles at and .  Note that is the side opposite the angle at and is the side opposite the angle at . Because and are the same measure, the sides opposite them are the corresponding pairs.  Similarly is the side opposite the angle at and is the side opposite the angle at . Because and are the same measure, the sides opposite them are the corresponding pairs.  What is the third pair of corresponding sides?  As a result the following ratios of sides are the same You can confirm this by dividing the lengths ( ).   From a single example we might think this was just a special case. To convince yourself use the following interactive example.   Similar Triangles      Calculating Using Similar Triangles  We can use the proportionaliy of similar triangle sides lengths to calculate the lengths using the same technique as .    Suppose triangle ABC has angles with the lengths of the sides opposite them . If triangle DEF also has angles it is similar. Suppose the length of the side opposite the angle at point F is .  First, we identify the corresponding sides. and are opposite angles so they are corresponding. and are opposite angles so they are corresponding. Finally, and are opposite angles so they are corresponding. This means  Because we know the ratio we can use the proportion to solve for the other two side lengths on triangle DEF. We invert the ratios for easier solving. We can calculate the length of the third side in the same way.       Similarity in Applications  Similar triangles can be found in a variety of circumstances. This example uses recognizes similar triangles in a context which has been used many time in history for indirect measurement.    A person is standing 30 ft from a light pole. The shadow cast by the light is 8 ft long. If the person is 5 ft 6 in tall, how high is the point on the light that is casting the shadow?  In this image we have two (right) triangles that will be useful. The smaller one has legs of length 8 ft and 5 ft 6 in. The third side (hypotenuse) is the dashed gray line, but we will not need it. The other triangle has a leg that is the entire bottom (length 8 ft plus 30 ft). The other leg is the height of the light. The angles of the two triangles are the same. Because they are both right triangles (we are supposing the light post is straight up and the person is standing straight up), the angles at the persons feet and the base of the light are the same. They share the angle on the left (between dashed line and ground). The third angle must match because the first two do.  Because these have the same angles they are similar and we can use the proportionality of ratios of corresponding side lengths. Before we do we will convert the height of the person to decimal. 5 ft 6 in is 5.5 ft. If these measurements were taken with a tape measure we can reasonably suppose they are accurate to the nearest inch. We can convert the 0.125 ft into inches. Thus the height to that point on the light is 26 ft and 2 in.  Note we use this type of measurement because it is simpler. We can measure across the ground much more easily than we can climb the pole and measure its height. It was not important that the person chose to be 30 ft from the pole. If they chose to be 20 ft, then the shadow would also be shorter (proportional). If we are too close it will be hard to accurately measure the short shadow (ever try to measure a shadow?).     Similarity Beyond Triangles  Shapes other than triangles can be similar. For example there are similar rectangles and similar pentagons. To be similar they must have the same number of sides, corresponding angles must be the same, and corresponding sides must be in the same ratio. Note that just having the same angles is insufficient: any two rectangles have all the same angles (right angles) but not every pair is similar.   Similar Polygons  One way to define similar polygons that avoids the trap illustrated by rectangles is to require every triangle made from vertices to have the same angles. Take two, non-similar rectangles and find the triangles that don't match.   One place where similar shapes (beyond triangles) is used is scale drawing and scale models. If you ever built a model of a car or a plane or some such there was most likely a scale given. For example they may be 1\/32 scale. This means that one inch on the model is 32 inches on the actual object.       Solve each of these proportions.         Identify a proportion in each application. Set it up, and solve for the requested value(s).               Use the property of side ratios for similar triangles to find the values requested.        Identify similar triangles in each application, then use the property of side ratios to find the requested value(s).         "

This means everything will be in ratio of 2\/1.  The proportion is based on original recipe and doubled recipe. That is every ingredient will be doubled: we must perform the calculation for eggs and cream cheese separately. We want the ratio of number of eggs in the doubled recipe to the number of eggs in the original recipe to be 2\/1. Thus Because the quantity to solve is in the numerator we can simply multiply to isolate that quantity (variable).  Note because we are using measurements in grams (mass\/weight) we used significant figures for rounding. In commercial recipes (and quality home cooking), weights are used because items like eggs are not uniform in mass. If we always use 3 eggs it might be more or less than we need messing up the food. Also note the 2 and 1 have infinite significant figures (they are exact numbers rather than approximated measurements).  "

In this image we have two (right) triangles that will be useful. The smaller one has legs of length 8 ft and 5 ft 6 in. The third side (hypotenuse) is the dashed gray line, but we will not need it. The other triangle has a leg that is the entire bottom (length 8 ft plus 30 ft). The other leg is the height of the light. The angles of the two triangles are the same. Because they are both right triangles (we are supposing the light post is straight up and the person is standing straight up), the angles at the persons feet and the base of the light are the same. They share the angle on the left (between dashed line and ground). The third angle must match because the first two do.  Because these have the same angles they are similar and we can use the proportionality of ratios of corresponding side lengths. Before we do we will convert the height of the person to decimal. 5 ft 6 in is 5.5 ft. If these measurements were taken with a tape measure we can reasonably suppose they are accurate to the nearest inch. We can convert the 0.125 ft into inches. Thus the height to that point on the light is 26 ft and 2 in.  Note we use this type of measurement because it is simpler. We can measure across the ground much more easily than we can climb the pole and measure its height. It was not important that the person chose to be 30 ft from the pole. If they chose to be 20 ft, then the shadow would also be shorter (proportional). If we are too close it will be hard to accurately measure the short shadow (ever try to measure a shadow?).  "

  "title": "Medical Ratios",
  "body": " Medical Ratios   This section addresses the following topics.  Interpret data in various formats and analyze mathematical models  Read and use mathematical models in a technical document  This section covers the following mathematical concepts.  Setup and solve proportions (skill)    This section uses medical applications, primarily determine medicine dosages, to illustrate the use of ratios including change of units and proportions. In each example look for how the ratio is recognized and how the information provided is used to setup a calculation.  A common application of ratios in medicine is creating drugs of a desired strength. For example some drugs need to be administered based on the body weight of the patient. This requires the medical personnel to mix the drug they have on hand to the needed strength.  We will work the following three types of medical problems.  Measure drug concentration  Dilute a drug to a lower concentration  Determine how much drug to use      Terminology  This section defines terminology used in medicine and sciences about solution concentrations that we need for the ratio examples in this section.  The active ingredient in a drug is often added to a inactive ingredient (often liquid) to administer it. This liquid is known as a diluent . The diluent might be water, saline solution, or other substances.  The substance (active ingredient for medicine) which may be a powder or another liquid to which the diluent is added is called the solute . The solute is disolved in the diluent. For example salt (solute) is disolved in water (diluent) to make saline solution.  Even if the drug can be administered directly (e.g., is already liquid) we sometimes need to dilute the stock solution (undiluted drug) for ease of use.  In some problems the drug mixture will be divided into parts. These parts are sometimes called aliquots . For example when testing substances (like blood samples) we may divide the sample drawn into multiple aliquots, one for each test to be run.  The most important concept is measuring how concentrated a solution is. This enables providing sufficient and safe amounts of drugs. There are three common ways concentration is written. These three are examples of how ratios can present the relationship between quantities in different ways. Being able to change between the different presentations of concentration will demonstrate your ability to understand and use ratios accurately.   Dilution Ratio   The Dilution Ratio is the ratio of solute (drug) to diluent.  If the solute is a liquid, then this is in units of volume per volume (e.g., mL per mL). For example a dilution ratio of 1:4 means 1 mL of drug to 4 mL of diluent giving 5 mL of solution.  This expression of concentration is unlikely to be used for dry solutes.     Dilution Factor   The Dilution Factor is the ratio of solute (drug) to the resulting solution.  If the solute is liquid, then this is in units of volume per volume. For example a dilution factor of 5 means 1 unit of the drug in every 5 units of solution implying 4 units of diluent (1\/4 dilution ratio).  If the solute is solid (e.g, powder) then this is in units of mass per volume. For example, 5 g of drug in a total of 100 mL of solution. Note we do not care how much diluent was added (hence we cannot calculate dilution ratio). This dilution factor can be achieved by putting in the dry ingredient, then adding part of the diluent to disolve the dry ingredient, then pouring in enough additional diluent to reach the desired volume.     Percent Concentration   The Percent Concentration is the ratio of mass of solute (drug) to 100 mL of diluent.  If the solute is liquid, then this is in units of volume per volume. For example if the are 2 mL of drug per 100 mL of solution, then the percenet concentration is 2\/100 or 2%.  If the solute is solid (e.g, powder) then this is in units of mass per volume. For example, if there are 2 mg of drug per 100 mL of solution, then the percent concentration is 2\/100 or 2%. Note this is neither percent by volume nor percent by mass as would be used in science.    These examples illustrate the meaning of these terms.   A solution is produced from 3 mL of concentrated chloroform and 37 mL of water.  What is the dilution ratio? The dilution ratio is the ratio of the solute to the diluent. We are given both. The dilution ratio is .  What is the dilution factor? The dilution factor is the ratio of the total to the substance. The total is substance plus diluent. Here that is . The ratio then is .  Calculate the percent concentration. The percent concentration is the ratio of the solute to the total solution by volume written as a percent. We are given the volume of the solute (3 mL) and have calculated the total volume in the previous task (40 mL). Thus the percent concentration is which is 7.5%.    Saline solution consists of the solute salt (sodium chloride) dissolved in the diluent pure water. The saline solution most commonly used in medical applications is 9 g of the solute salt, which is a solid, dissolved in enough water to make 1 liter of solution.  Because the solution is produced by adding enough water (amount not specified) it is easiest to express the concentration as a dilution factor. For medicine these are most commonly expressed in terms of milliliters, so we will convert units ( metric terminology ). The dilution factor is  We can also calculate the percent concentration. To do this we need to express volume in milliliters (percent concentration is ratio of solute to 100 mL). We can use unit conversion from above. The percent concentration is or 0.9%.  Note how comparing the information provided to the definition showed us we needed to perform a unit conversion. The definitions also stated which number is numerator and denominator and what form to use for a final expression (e.g., percent or fraction).    Clorox Disinfecting Bleach contains 7.0% sodium hypochlorite which is a liquid. This means the percent concentration is 7.0%. From this information we can calculate the dilution ratio and dilution factor.  One commercially available size of bleach contains 11 oz. To calculate the dilution ratio and dilution factor we need to know the amount of solute (sodium hypochlorite) in the 11 oz. Because it has a percent concentration of 7.0% there is oz of sodium hypochlorite.  This is all we need for the dilution factor which is . This would be easier to read if we reduce it or expressed in ounces of bleach to ounces of water.  For the dilution ratio we need the amount of water added. Because the total solution is 11 oz and we know 0.77 oz is bleach, the water is oz. Thus the dilution ratio is .  This ratio is hard to interpret, so we should reduce the fraction. We can perform this reduction multiple ways.   Another options is  The ratio means there is one ounce of bleach for every 13.29 ounces of water.   Note a pure substance has dilution factor 1\/1 (the total volume of the solution is just the volume of the solute). The percent concentration for a pure substance is 100%.   Use these Checkpoints to test your ability to calculate these ratios.      Dilution  This section shows how to use knowledge of proportions to perform calculations required in medicine. Dilution ratios or factors tell us a desired ratio, and we know the initial ratio. This pair allows us to setup a proportion.  This first example shows how to produce a solution with a desired dilution factor.   How much diluent do we need to add to produce a solution containing 3.0 mL of concentrated chloroform that will have a dilution factor of ?  The dilution factor is the ratio of the total to the substance. We want that to equal , so we can write the proportion  We are not given the total volume, but the total is the volume of the solute plus the volume of the diluent. We do know the volume of solute (3.0 mL), and the volume of diluent is what we want to calculate. We can call the volume of diluent . The volume of the solution is where is the volume of diluent to add.  Because we are starting with 3.0 mL of concentrated chloroform (no dilution) our proportion is So we need 147 mL of diluent. Notice once we had the proportion set up we needed only use algebra.   This example shows us how to apply a dilution ratio (dilute our solution). We can calculate the resulting dilution factor afterward.   A doctor orders 120 mL of 50% solution of Ensure every two hours. How much Ensure (liquid) and water is needed?  50% is a percent concentration. This means the Ensure should be 50% of the total volume (120 mL). mL of Ensure. This leaves mL of water (diluent).  The dilution ratio is 1\/1, because there is the same volume of solute (Ensure) and diluent (water). The dilution factor is 1\/2, because we have 60 mL of Ensure in 120 mL of solution ( ).   Working on dilutions is a proportion problem. This next example presents a scenario where we work a dilution problem backwards. Notice that the setup is still a proportion and the solving is still just the algebra steps needed.    One usage of dilution is to reduce the concentration so that instruments can accurately measure it. Consider trying to measure an acid without dissolving the tools used to measure it.  A sample of a suspected high blood glucose value was obtained. According to the manufacturer of the instrument used to read blood glucose values, the highest glucose result which can be obtained on this particular instrument is 500 mg\/dL. When the sample was run, the machine gave an error message (concentration too high).  The serum was then diluted to 1\/10 and retested. The machine gave a result of 70 mg\/dL. What was the initial concentration?  Note that the ratio is milligrams to decilitres (weight to volume). In these types of problems the amount of substance is so small that it does not affect the volume.    Before we jump into an equation, let's try an experiment. That's right, in math we do not have to know what to do when we start. We will try something and learn from it, maybe revising our approach after the first try.  This is a dilution problem which means we can setup the proportion  We are trying to find the amount of blood sugar in the sample, so the solute portion is unknown. We also do not have the size of sample taken. We will experiment to see how this affects the problem.  Suppose we take 1 dL of the original serum. Because the blood sample is so small, we can calculate as if all the volume is the diluent. That is we started with 1 dL and added more to dilute. To dilute to a ratio of 1\/10 we need to add dL of diluent. No blood glucose was added thus the concentration is changed only by the diluent. Thus the concentration proportion is now Did this result depend on our selecting 1 dL of the original serum? If we are uncertain we can try the problem again and select 2 dL of the original serum. To figure out the total amount of which 2 is 1\/10, we can treat this like  This means we need dL of diluent to have the desired dilution ratio. Also we will have twice as much of the blood glucose. Notice the result is the same. This makes sense, because we are setting up a proportion, and ratios do not depend on the amount.  We can be confident that the original serum sample had a blood glucose level of 700 mg\/dL.    Sometimes we dilute more than one time. Here we experiment to determine what the effect of serial dilution is upon the resulting dilution factor.    Suppose you have a solution consisting of 10 mL of acyl chloride and 90 mL of water. If this is diluted to a dilution ratio of 1\/2 and then diluted again to a dilution ratio of 1\/3, what is the final dilution ratio?    We can do the calculations one at a time. First we calculate the original concentration. To dilute to a ratio of 1\/2 we can calculate the amount of diluent to add as a proportion problem like in . The total will be 200 mL so we need to add of additional diluent. Note at this point the concentration is To dilute again to a ratio of 1\/3 we can calculate the amount of diluent to add The total will be 600 mL so we need to add of additional diluent. Note at this point the concentration is Now we can determine what the resulting dilution ratio after diluting twice (1\/2 and then 1\/3).  Notice that . This relationship is always true for serial dilution.      Dosage  If we know the concentration of a drug, we can determine how much is needed for a given dose. These are proportion problems that require change of units.  In medicine some substances are measured in International Unit or IU. For each substance this is defined by the effect of that amount of the drug.    One IU of insulin is 0.0347 mg. A common concentration of insulin is U-100 which is 100 IU\/mL. This is produced by combining 100 units of insulin in one mL of diluent.  If a person needs 2 units of insulin, how many mL of solution will that be?    This can be solved as a proportion because are asked for an amount that matches a ratio. The ratio (concentration) is 100 IU\/mL. Because we are solving for a number of mL, we will write the ratio as    Because we have a ratio of desired amount to provided amount we can also solve this problem as a percent.  The ratio is desired amount\/provided amount. In this case which is 2%. We therefore want 2% of the 1 mL (from 100 IU\/1 mL) or 0.02 mL.      A label reads 2.5 mL of solution for injection contains 1000 mg of streptomycin sulfate. How many milliliters are needed to contain 800 mg of streptomycin?    Because a ratio is given (1000 mg\/2.5 mL) and we want to scale this (to 800 mg), this can be setup as a proportion.  Because we want to solve for volume (mL) we setup the proportion as follows.    Because we have a ratio of desired amount to provided amount we can also solve this problem as a percent.  The ratio is desired amount\/provided amount. In this case which is 80%. We therefore want 80% of the 2.5 mL does or 2 mL.      A physician may prescribe a medicine and specify a total amount and a speed at which it should be delivered. For IV's this is called drop factor and is specified as a number of drops per minute. Medical personnel must calculate how long to operate the IV so that the total amount of drug prescribed is delivered in the specified time.    Give 1500 mL of saline solution IV with a drop factor of 10 drops per mL at a rate of 50 drops per minute to an adult patient. Determine how long in hours the IV should be administered.    The rate is specified in drops and the amount is specified in mL which means we need to convert units. This will be done like . Now that we know the rate in mL, we can setup a proportion so that time calculated per total grams of medication matches the specified rate. Notice how we invert the rate to make the algebra easier. The final step is to convert minutes to hours. This is another unit conversion problem using a conversion from . The units suggest we can multiply the 300 minutes by the conversion ratio.       Amoxicillin is an antibiotic obtainable in a liquid suspension form, part medication and part water, and is frequently used to treat infections in infants. One formulation of the drug contains 125 mg of amoxicillin per 5 mL of liquid. A pediatrician orders mg per day for a 4-month-old child with an ear infection. How much of the amoxicillin suspension would the parent need to administer to the infant in order to achieve the recommended daily dose?    Here we need to scale the amount (from 125 mg to mg). This is a proportion problem, that is, the ratio of medicine to volume is the same so we can setup an equation based on the drug concentration.     A 5% dextrose solution (D5W) contains 5 g of pure dextrose per 100 mL of solution. A doctor orders 500 mL of D5W IV for a patient. How much dextrose does the patient receive from that IV?   Once again we need to scale the amount (from 100 mL to 500 mL). This is also a proportion problem, that is, the ratio of medicine to volume is the same so we can setup an equation based on the drug concentration.    A sample of chloroform water has a dilution factor of 40. If 2 mL of chloroform are needed how many milliliters total are needed?  A dilution factor of 40 indicates that 1 mL of chloroform is in 40 mL total of solution. We can setup a proportion to answer this.

  "body": "  One usage of dilution is to reduce the concentration so that instruments can accurately measure it. Consider trying to measure an acid without dissolving the tools used to measure it.  A sample of a suspected high blood glucose value was obtained. According to the manufacturer of the instrument used to read blood glucose values, the highest glucose result which can be obtained on this particular instrument is 500 mg\/dL. When the sample was run, the machine gave an error message (concentration too high).  The serum was then diluted to 1\/10 and retested. The machine gave a result of 70 mg\/dL. What was the initial concentration?  Note that the ratio is milligrams to decilitres (weight to volume). In these types of problems the amount of substance is so small that it does not affect the volume.    Before we jump into an equation, let's try an experiment. That's right, in math we do not have to know what to do when we start. We will try something and learn from it, maybe revising our approach after the first try.  This is a dilution problem which means we can setup the proportion  We are trying to find the amount of blood sugar in the sample, so the solute portion is unknown. We also do not have the size of sample taken. We will experiment to see how this affects the problem.  Suppose we take 1 dL of the original serum. Because the blood sample is so small, we can calculate as if all the volume is the diluent. That is we started with 1 dL and added more to dilute. To dilute to a ratio of 1\/10 we need to add dL of diluent. No blood glucose was added thus the concentration is changed only by the diluent. Thus the concentration proportion is now Did this result depend on our selecting 1 dL of the original serum? If we are uncertain we can try the problem again and select 2 dL of the original serum. To figure out the total amount of which 2 is 1\/10, we can treat this like  This means we need dL of diluent to have the desired dilution ratio. Also we will have twice as much of the blood glucose. Notice the result is the same. This makes sense, because we are setting up a proportion, and ratios do not depend on the amount.  We can be confident that the original serum sample had a blood glucose level of 700 mg\/dL.   "

This results from navigation methods (search for VOR and DME arc if curious). To estimate on the fly they use what is known as the 60:1:1 approximation. It means that 60 miles from a point a one degree arc is approximately one mile in length. Note in aviation the distances would be in nautical miles (nm), but the ratio does not change if we use statute miles (the usual type).  Here we will practice using the method to approximate then check why it works.   Using the Ratio  View to .   What is the arclength of 2 degrees at a distance of 30 miles?

This results from navigation methods (search for VOR and DME arc if curious). To estimate on the fly they use what is known as the 60:1:1 approximation. It means that 60 miles from a point a one degree arc is approximately one mile in length.

  "body": " Linear Expressions   This section addresses the following topics.  Interpret data in various formats and analyze mathematical models  Read and use mathematical models in a technical document  This section covers the following mathematical concepts.  Solve linear , rational, quadratic, and exponential equations and formulas (skill)  Read and interpret models (critical thinking)  Use models including linear , quadratic, exponential\/logarithmic, and trigonometric (skill)    Having looked at models in general this section presents linear models. First, we look at some examples and learn how the pieces of a linear model work. Next, we learn to write linear models given a description of a problem. After that we practice solving for different parts of a linear equation. will introduce a more in depth look at identifying linear models.    Linear Models  This section presents examples of linear models and provides an explanation for the two parts of a linear model.  A linear model (equation) can be written in the following, equivalent forms.    The second form can be solved for y which will make it look like the first form.   Model of Temperature Change with Altitude  As a result of atmospheric physics temperature decreases as the distance above the ground increases. For lower altitudes this can be modeled as   is the expected temperature at the specified altitude.  is the temperature at ground level.  is the specified altitude in number of feet above ground level.  is the rate of temperature decrease.  All temperatures are in Fahrenheit.  Before we can use this model we need to know the parameter . A parameter is not a variable, rather it is a value (number) that we obtain from the circumstances and write into the model (equation) before we do any work.  In contrast the ratio is a constant (not a parameter), because it is a result of atmospheric physics that is not dependent on the location for this simplified model.  Temperature ( ) and altitude ( ) are variables which implies that the model shows a relationship between these two properties.  The model subtracts from the starting temperature results in a decrease of temperature from . This implies that temperature decreases with altitude.  Every linear model (equation) has a rate. In this case .  Every linear model has a shift, which may be zero. In this case .     If the temperature at ground level is 43 what is the temperature 1000 ft above ground level (AGL)? 2000 ft AGL, 3000 ft AGL, 3500 ft AGL?  Because fractions of a degree are not useful in making decisions like what to wear, we will round to units.    Note . We need to calculate for .  Notice that we now know that it will be below freezing just above 3000 ft.     Model of Time to Altitude  A fixed wing aircraft flown optimally climbs from a starting altitude at a fixed climb rate.   is the altitude after minutes.  is the starting altitude (likely ground level) in feet mean sea level (MSL).  is the rate of climb in feet per minute.  is the time since the climb began in minutes.   Before we can use this model we need to know the parameters and . A parameter is not a variable, rather it is a value (number) that we obtain from the circumstances and write into the model (equation) before we do any work. varies by airport, because they are at different altitudes. The rate must be obtained for each plane and is often available in the aircraft's Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).  Final altitude ( ) and time ( ) are the variables which implies that the model shows a relationship between time climbing and how high the plane is.  In this model everything is added which matches the increase of elevation over time (adding makes the altitude bigger).  Every linear model (equation) has a rate. In this case .  Every linear model has a shift, which may be zero. In this case .     If a plane begins at 160 ft MSL and is climbing at 700 ft\/min, how high will it be after 5 minutes? 10 minutes? 15 minutes?  These calculations are made as part of safety planning. The data is sufficiently accurate that rounding is not necessary. Rather we make conservative estimates of the parameters, so that there is always a safety buffer. In this case a conservative estimate for is to round down: this will give us a lower altitude. If that lower altitude is safe, then one 5 feet higher will be safe as well. For the climb rate a conservative estimate is to round down as well. If we can reach an altitude at 700 ft\/min, then we will reach it a little earlier at 720 ft\/min.    Note The expected altitudes are  Note if we need to climb above 4500 ft MSL we will achieve this in between 5 and 10 minutes (closer to 5).     Model of Fuel Remaining Calculation  When operated at a fixed power setting a vehicle burns the same amount of gas per hour (or other time unit). This leads to the linear model   is the amount of fuel remaining after minutes.  is the amount of fuel at the beginning.  is the rate (volume per time) at which fuel is being consumed.  is the time the vehicle has been operated.  Fuel amounts will be measured in units of volume like gallons or liters. Time will be measured in minutes or hours. The rate is then in units such as gallons\/hour or liters\/min.  Before we can use this model we need to know the parameters and . These parameters are not variables (they remains the same the whole time the model is in use), rather they are values (numbers) that we obtain from the circumstances and write into the model (equation) before we do any work.  The initial fuel is obtained by checking the fuel tanks or fuel gauges. The rate is often is not shown during operation (fuel gauges show how much is remaining rather than how fast it is used). The rate can sometimes be obtained from vehicle documentation.  Final fuel ( ) and time ( ) are the variables which implies that the model shows a relationship between time flown and fuel available (left in the tanks).  Because fuel decreases the term is subtracted decreasing the amount from .  Every linear model (equation) has a rate. In this case (or similar units).  Every linear model has a shift, which may be zero. In this case .     If a car begins with 20 gallons of fuel and burns 1.55 gallons per hour, how much fuel will it have after 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 36 minutes?  A gallon is a large amount so we will maintain one decimal place precision. For safety we should always assume a larger fuel burn, so we will round fuel remaining down.    Note Thus    Use this Checkpoint to practice using a linear model.     Building Linear Models  The previous section presented linear models, and illustrated using provided models. This section presents problems that can be modeled as linear equations, and illustrates writing the model (equation) before using it.  A linear model has a starting point (shift, ) and rate (ratio, ). We need to identify these and then write the linear model with these values. We should also label units and explain any parameters.   Consider rope that costs $0.93 per foot with a shipping charge of $7.64. To produce a model for the cost of each purchase we will start by trying a couple specific orders.  Suppose we are purchasing 20 feet of this rope. The cost for the 20 feet will be , because each foot is $0.93. This is just like unit conversion: the units ($\/ft and ft) suggest multiplying.  Notice this multiplication is also the same as using a ratio (proportion). We could setup When we solve this we end up with the same multiplication .  Next we must add the shipping charge. Thus the final cost is . Note there is no rounding because all numbers are exact (no measurements, so no signficant digits) and no fractions of a cent occurred.  Suppose we are purchasing 100 feet of this rope. The cost for the 100 feet will be . Then we must add the shipping charge. Thus the final cost is .  Notice we could do this with any number of feet (unless the shipping charge increases for larger orders). So in general we can write the cost as .  Notice that this equation has a ratio (0.93\/1), which is the cost per foot, but also has a shift (+7.64), which is the fixed shipping cost. Thus this is another linear equation.   When cost is set per linear foot, or per square yard, or similar per unit pricing we often end up with a linear model.   At lower altitudes the barometric pressure typically drops 1 inHg for every 1000 feet of elevation gained (the air is less dense higher up). To produce a model for pressure decrease we will start by calculating the pressure for a couple specific cases.  If the pressure on the ground is 29.76 inHg, what do we expect the pressure to be flying at 4500 ft above ground level?  The pressure drop is a ratio . The units suggest we can multiply . This is the drop in pressure. To calculate the resulting pressure we need . We retain 2 decimal places because that is the traditional amount for reporting by meteorologists. Written as one calculation this is  If the pressure on the ground is 30.02 inHg what do we expect the pressure to be flying at 6000 ft above ground level?  The pressure drop is a ratio . The units suggest we can multiply . This is the drop in pressure. To calculate the resulting pressure we need . Written as one calculation this is  Notice we could do this same calculation for any altitude. So in general we can write  is the pressure at the specified altitude. is the pressure at ground level. is the altitude above ground level. This is a linear equation with a ratio of (-1\/1000) which is the drop in pressure with altitude, and a shift of , which is the pressure on the ground.    We will find a model (equation) that converts temperature in Fahrenheit to temperature in Celsius. Note that every 9 degrees F is only 5 degrees C, so to convert we must scale the degrees. Also they use different values for the starting point (which is the freezing point of water). Fahrenheit starts at 32 and Celsius starts at 0 . Notice we have a ratio and a shift, so this already looks like a linear model.  To begin with we will convert 52 F to Celsius. We will round to units, because this is just an example (no one will be injured in the demonstration of this model).  The first step is to determine how many degrees above freezing. Because 32 F is the freezing temperature of water, 52 F is above freezing.  The next step is to scale the degrees. The conversion ratio is . Converting the 20 above freezing is now a unit conversion. The units suggest we can multiply . Notice we flipped the conversion ratio so the Fahrenheit degrees would divide to one. The result is 11 C above the freezing point of water in Celsius.  Finally we can add the degrees Celsius to the starting point (freezing temperature of water). Because that is 0 , we have C.  If we write all of that as one step we obtain .  Notice we could do this with any temperature. So if we call the temperature to convert we have . This may not look like a starting point plus a ratio scaled. If we expand the expression we obtain So this is a linear model. We prefer the first form of the equation because the numbers have meaning (e.g., 32 is the freezing point of water as opposed to which has no useful meaning.   The temperature conversion example illustrates an idea about models. We describe a linear model as having a ratio and a (that is one) shift. However, in the temperature conversion example there is a shift a ratio and another shift, or two shifts. We showed these can be combined as one shift. That is always true. However, sometimes the version with multiple shifts is easier to understand. This will be true when we look at graphs of quadratics and exponentials (other forms of models).    Solving Linear Equations  The first section demonstrated using linear models to calculate values. However, sometimes we know the result and want to know the input. This requires solving the linear equation. This section reviews solving linear equation starting with non-contextualized examples and then using some of the models presented above.  Before reading farther solve the equation . What steps did you use? Why do they work? is an example of solving another linear equation.   Solve .  Note we added three because it eliminates the -3 (undoes subtraction of 3). We divided by negative eight because it eliminates the -8 (undoes the multiplication by -8).    Some linear equations need one more technique. What would you need to solve ? Below is an example of solving a similar linear equation.   Solve .  Notice we had to combine like terms (factor and add).    Another linear equation is . How would you solve it?  We can solve this the same as in but there is another technique as well whic is shown below.   Solve  This is referred to as clearing denominators. We are once again eliminating division by multiplying. Always remember to distribute. Note, we could multiply once if we figured out the correct number (it would be 35 in this case), but there are no prizes for doing this fast, so you can do this either way.   Now that we have practiced solving linear equations, we can use this skill with the models.   Given the temperature model in and supposing the temperature at ground level is 65, determine at what altitude we expect the temperature to be freezing.  In this case the model is . We know and we want to calculate , the altitude in feet. We round to the tens position because that is the precision shown by many altimeters.    Given the time to altitude model in and supposing that we are climbing from 80 ft MSL to 5000 ft MSL with a climb rate of 700 ft\/min, how long will it take to complete the climb?  In this case the model is . We know ft, and we want to know the time . We round up as a safety margin: it is better to assume we need 8 minutes and be higher than to hope we can recognize 0.03 of a minute (not quite 2 seconds).   Use this Checkpoint to try solving a linear model.     Identifying Linear Expressions  All of the equations in this section are linear. What can we use to identify linear expressions or linear equations? shows examples of linear expressions and non-linear expressions.   Linear and Non-linear   Linear Non-linear       Some equations that may not appear to be linear can be solved using the same methods.   Solve .    In we will learn to identify linear models from data.    Solve  Solve  Solve  Solve  Solve  Solve  Solve  Solve  Solve  Solve  Solve  Solve  Solve  Solve  Solve   "

  "title": "Representing Data",
  "body": " Representing Data   This section addresses the following topics.  Interpret data in various formats and analyze mathematical models  Communicate results in mathematical notation and in language appropriate to the technical field  This section covers the following mathematical concepts.  Identify rates as linear, quadratic, exponential, or other (critical thinking)  Identify data varrying directly or indirectly (critical thinking)    We often represent numerical data using tables, diagrams, and graphs. These include various kinds of charts like bar graphs and pie charts, and graphs of functions. We do this to make certain traits of the data easier to notice. Here we will look at how some of these are produced and begin to learn to recognize differences due to rates. More details about rates will be covered in .    Reading Tables of Data  This section illustrates how some data can be stored in tables, how to read data from a table, and how to infer additional data when reasonable.  Tables are useful if we have a limited number of entries, and the data can be indexed by two traits. The two traits become headers for the rows and columns. Note by limited number of entries we mean that the table can be easily used. If the table has more entries than we can see on a page or screen, it becomes less easy to use. Technology can make it easier to find the desired row and column such as a spreadsheet with the row and column headings frozen.   Stall speed at 2550 lbs, most rearward center of gravity, speeds KIAS   Angle of Bank  Flap Setting 0 30 45 60  Up 48 52 57 68  Approach 43 46 51 61  Landing 40 43 48 57    We do not need to understand what bank, flap, and stall speed mean to read this table. Indeed a table can be presented precisely to help explain what terms mean. However, to satisfy your curiosity note that stall speed refers to the speed at which a wing will produce insufficient lift to keep a plane flying. Falling beneath this speed typically results in the plane lowering its nose to regain speed. Angle of bank refers to how steeply the plane is tipped (left or right) in order to turn. KIAS stands for knots indicated air speed. Indicated airspeed is a speed pilots can see (think speedometer). Flaps are a structure extended for landing and sometimes take-off. Up means they are not in use. Approach and landing refer to varying degrees of extension.   What is the stall speed in a 30 bank angle with flaps up?  We can determine this by looking for the column labeled 30 and the row labeled Up . In that cell is the number 52. Thus the stall speed at that bank angle with flaps up is 52 KIAS.    In what condition is the stall speed the highest?  If we read all three rows, the largest number we find is 68. That is in the Up row and 60 column. So the stall speed is highest in the steep, 60 turn with the flaps in the up position.  Note, there is no shortcut here for checking the entry in every row and column.     As the angle of bank increases (from 0 to 60 ) what happens to the stall speed?    If we look in the Up row, the stall speed changes from 48 to 52 to 57 to 68. The first thing we notice is that the stall speed increases.  If we repeat this in the Approach row, we again see the speeds are increasing. The same is true in the Landing row.  Thus we can say that stall speed increases as the angle of bank increases.  In later sections ( ) we will learn to be more specific about patterns when possible.     Sometimes we want to know data that is between entries in a table. We can estimate these values if we know or can safely assume some property about the data. Below we show interpolation based on linear data. Linear data is described in and .   What is the stall speed in a 15 bank angle with flaps in the Approach setting?  First, we note that there is no column for 15 bank angle. However we have 0 and 30 . 15 is half way between these two. For this chart it is reasonable to estimate our desired stall speed by calculating the number half way between those in the table.  The two stall speeds are 43 and 46. The number in between (the average) is . When considering stall speeds, it is safest to assume a higher stall speed, so we will round to 45 KIAS.      Reading Graphs  This section illustrates how some data can be represented in graphs and how to read data from a graph including some comparisons of graphs.  Graphs that are curves (like lines) are read by finding a vertical heading that matches our question (think row) and read the corresponding horizontal heading (think column). Note this could be reversed, that is, find a horizontal heading that matches and read the corresponding vertical one.   If the plane with maximum engine out glide represented in is 2400 ft above the ground how many nautical miles can it glide forward?  First we note that 2400 ft matches the vertical axis. We want to find the line across the graph that represents 2400 ft. Note, no line is labeled 2400, but we do have 2000 and 4000 and there are lines between them. To figure out which of these lines we should use, we must figure out how many feet each minor line represents.  Counting we find 10 minor lines between each major line. Because each major line represents 2000 ft, we know the minor lines represent ft.  Because we want the second minor line above 2000. We follow that to the blue line, then we follow the gray (minor) line down to the bottom. Our result is two minor lines before 4.  We must figure out how much each minor vertical line represents. Each vertical major line is 2 nm. Again there are 10 minor lines between each major line, so we know the minor lines represent nm.  The glide distance for 2400 ft is therefore nm. We subtracted here because it is before 4.    Graph Representing Maximum Engine Out Glide     When we look at any table, graph, or figure we should ask ourselves why various choices were made. We may need to ask someone with related knowledge for an explanation.   Consider . The input we use is Height Above Ground (ft) . Frequently we place the inputs on the x-axis. Why was the y-axis chosen for the inputs here?  Consider that the inputs are heights . This is a y-axis concept, so it matches our expectations. Reading the graph is not affected by this choice.  Why do the inputs begin at 0 and end at 12000?  They begin at 0, because we are talking about a plane gliding to the ground. A plane must be above the ground (above 0) to glide.  They end at 12000 in this case, because this aircraft cannot fly higher than that altitude. We do not need data for cases that cannot occur.  Why are the inputs labeled every 2000 and the inputs every 2?  This is purely space available. If we put in more labels they would overlap each other.   Graphs can be from raw data which may appear random. We still read these graphs the same way.   has the temperature and dewpoint read by a radiosonde (instruments on weather balloon) as it rose in the atmosphere. Note the vertical axis is the pressure reading. This is not the same as altitude, but it does correspond mostly to altitude. Dew point is the temperature at which water will condense, so it is also a temperature.  What are the temperature and dewpoint at the 700 millibar level?  We follow the 700 mb line over to the dewpoint (green, dashed) line. It is not quite halfway between -20 C and 0 . We estimate -7 C. Continuing across the 700 mb line to the temperature (red, solid) line we find it a little closer to 0 . We estimate the temperature is 5 C.    Graph of Temperature and Dewpoint    Note some charts like are not meant to convey specific numbers but rather to show trends.   Notice that while the temperature (red, solid line) wiggles around, it trends down as the pressure decreases. That is temperature decreases as altitude increases. We expect this, because it is farther from the ground which heats the air.  Clouds form when the temperature reaches the dewpoint and the air is saturated (has enough moisture). We see in three places where temperature and dewpoint are the same. The lowest is between 800 and 700 millibars (we estimate 750 millibars). The second is between 700 and 600 millibars (we estimate 650 millibars). The third is at about 500 millibars. We would expect clouds to form at these altitudes.    Consider . The input we use is Pressure (millibars) . Why was the y-axis chosen for the inputs here?  The pressure readings correspond to altitudes (height) which we tend to think of as up. Putting this on the y-axis matches this expectation.  Why do the y-axis labels decrease as they go up?  Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, so low pressure means higher altitude. The pressure readings are arranged to be low altitude at the bottom and high altitude at the top.  Why do the inputs begin at 1000?  Because the pressure readings correspond to altitude the highest pressure should be on the ground. It turns out 1013 is a typical pressure at ground level, so much higher pressure readings are not expected.  Why are the output labels from -100 to 40?  These are based on commonly experienced temperatures. Temperatures lower than -100 C are not expected. Temperatures above 40 C do occur, but not in the location where this sounding was taken.  Use to convert 50 C to Fahrenheit to see why this temperature is uncommon in most locations.   The input for the glide ratio questions is altitude. Altitudes are continuous that is it makes sense to refer to an altitude of 2453.27 feet (fractional feet). Similarly the pressure levels are continuous, that is it makes sense to refer to 501.7 millibar level. However, there is data where a fraction does not make sense. This discrete data is often graphed differently. The next examples illustrate a way of presenting discrete data.   Increasing Income  When Vasya was hired in 2017 she was paid an annual salary of $62,347.23. Her work has been good, so each year she has received raises of $5000.00.  To represent this data we first need to calculate her salary each year. We do this by starting with her initial salary, then for each year adding the $5000 raise to the previous year's salary. This is an iterative process. contains the results. Notice a table is a good means to represent discrete data.  We will represent her salary over time using the bar graph in . Notice the horizontal axis is labeled with years and the vertical axis is labeled in dollars. There is one bar for each year, because her salary was changed only once each year. Bar graphs are a good option for discrete data.  Consider the bar graph (ignore the table). Can you tell that Vasya's salary is increasing? Can you tell how much? How might the graph be changed to make information easier to find?    Vasya's Salary   2017  $62,347.23   2018  $67,347.23   2019  $72,347.23   2020  $77,347.23   2021  $82,347.23   2022  $87,347.23   2023  $92,347.23   2024  $97,347.23      Vasya's Salary      Vasya wishes to know how her raises are helping her keep up with increasing costs. shows her raises as a percent of her previous year's salary and the inflation rate ( ) If her raises are at least as large as inflation, then her spending power is not diminished (keeping up)   Using confirm that the graph shows the correct percent increase for 2021. Recall her raise is $5000 each year. The graph shows the raise as a percent of the previous year.   For these years is she keeping up with inflation?   Her raise is a larger percent each year except for two. In those two years it is close. She has been more than keeping up with inflation.    What trend do you notice in the percent increase of salary? Why is this happening?   Her percent drops from about 8% to a little over 5%. This results from her raise being the same amount but her previous year's salary is bigger each year. In the percent (part\/whole) the part remains fixed while the whole increases.  Unless there is a change this will lead to her raises eventually not keeping up with inflation.     Vasya's Salary     Consider . It contains Guido's annual salary for each year listed. The second bar is the first year's salary increased each year to match inflation. That is it shows what Guido's salary would have been if his raises had exactly matched inflation.   In which years did Guido receive a raise?   The bars show an increase from 2017 to 2018, 2018 to 2019, 2022 to 2023, and 2023 to 2024. He received raises in 2018, 2019, 2022, 2023, and 2024.   In which years did Guido's salary appear to grow at least as much as inflation?   We can see that his salary was bigger than the inflation adjusted amount in 2018 and 2019. Those raises were larger than inflation.  We cannot tell if his raises in 2022-24 were larger, because his salary was so far behind that even if his raise was larger than inflation that year, it would not make up for the years without a raise.    Salary vs Inflation      Using Graphs to Analyze Models  Above we practiced interpreting graphs provided for us. This section presents generating graphs to analyze and interpret models. While we will rely on technology to produce graphs, these examples begin with manual generation of graphs because that process helps us understand a model and it helps us understand what the graphs mean.   Scale Model  A model of a space shuttle is labeled as 1:144. This means one inch on the model represents 144 inches on the actual shuttle, that is, there is a ratio between the size of objects on the model and the size of the objects on the actual shuttle. If a portion of the model is 1.72 inches then means the part on the actual shuttle is inches. In general where is the size on the model and is the size on the actual shuttle.  To represent this scale conversion as a graph we will generate a table like then we will use that to plot the graph.   Model  Full Size   1.0  144   1.5  216   2.0  288   2.5  360   3.0  432    We sketch a graph by plotting the points first. Notice the five points based on the table above. Through the points we draw a curve: in this case it is a line. The graph is in .  For the curious, software uses this same process to produce a graph. It usually plots a much larger number of points and then connects the dots with short line segments.    Why does the graph start at 0? The inputs are lengths on the model; negative lengths do not make sense.  Why does it end at 4? If we wanted all sizes from zero to the largest dimension of the shuttle, we would need a bigger graph. However, because this is a line, we have a good idea what the rest of the graph looks like.  This graph is a line. We knew it would be because is in the form of a line (as shown in ).    Graph of Scale    The next example is a shape we have not yet encountered in this text.   Ohm's Law  Recall Ohm's Law from . We will explore the relationship between current ( ) and resistance ( ).  To begin the exploration and to enable graphing we will complete a table. First it will be convenient to solve Ohm's law for current ( ). Because we are interested in the effect of resistance on current we will pick a fixed voltage: V. Thus our equation is .   Resistance  Current   1.0  12   4.0  3.0   8.0  1.5   12.0  1.0   16.0  0.75    We can plot these points and sketch a curve through them. This graph is in .  The apparent relationship between current and resistance for a fixed voltage is that current decreases as resistance increase.  The graph starts with 1 Ohm. Why does it not start at 0? If resistance were 0, then the equation becomes . Division by zero does not make arithmetic sense. 0 ohm resistance means no resistance and this is not physically possible (nothing is perfect). Thus the math model fits the physical reality.     Graph of Ohms Law    The ideal gas law expresses a relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas. It is given by where is the pressure, is the volume, is the temperature, and is a constant dependent on the specific gas. Draw a graph for the equation . Note the units are Kelvin (Celsius + 273.15) for temperature and Jules\/litre for pressure. These do not need to be labeled here. Draw a graph for the equation .    Graphing Lines  We have seen what linear data looks like in data tables, discrete graphs (e.g., bar graph), and continuous graphs. This section presents how to graph lines if we have the equation and presents analyzing linear models based on their graphs.  As described in a linear equation (model) has two parts: and . First, we address the role of the ratio in the graph.   Slope   The rate of change of a line (graph) is called its slope . The numerator is the change in y and the denominator is the change in x. Slope can be calculated as Rise and run are terms to help us remember the formula.    In we graphed a linear equation with the ratio 144 real inches to 1 model inch. In the linear model we have that is 144 is the change in y and and 1 is the change in x.  Because the rate of change is the fixed, the slope can be calculated from any two points. We can calculate the slope from points in a table or points from a graph using . The next example illustrates calculating the slope from two points and that the slope is the same regardless of points selected.   Calculate Slope  The graph in is linear. We will calculate the slope twice.  First, we will use the points and . This means the slope is a decrease of 1.00 inHg (inch of mercury) per increase of feet above mean sea level.  We will use the points and . As expected this is the same slope, because on a line the rate of change (slope) is constant.    Calculating Slope    To write the equation for a line we need the shift as well as the slope. This can also be read from the graph. The slope determines how tilted the line is. After this that line can be moved up or down. controls this shift. It is typically easiest to read this shift at because in the linear form we have , so the coordinate at is the shift.   Calculate Shift   The graph in is linear. We will calculate the shift.   The shift can be read when . That point is not labeled on the graph. However, we can calculate it using one of the points and the ratio.  We will use to find the pressure using a proportion. We want the point 2000 feet below this point, and pressure increases as we go down so we set up Thus the pressure should increase by 2.00 inHg giving us . Thus the point is and the shift is .  Combining this shift with the slope from the example above the model is   is the pressure at altitude .  29.92 is the initial pressure.  The rate is .  is the altitude above ground level.  If we replaced 29.92 with a parameter we could generalize the model to .        Answer these questions about interpreting data.

They begin at 0, because we are talking about a plane gliding to the ground. A plane must be above the ground (above 0) to glide.  They end at 12000 in this case, because this aircraft cannot fly higher than that altitude. We do not need data for cases that cannot occur.  Why are the inputs labeled every 2000 and the inputs every 2?  This is purely space available. If we put in more labels they would overlap each other.  "

We expect this, because it is farther from the ground which heats the air.  Clouds form when the temperature reaches the dewpoint and the air is saturated (has enough moisture). We see in three places where temperature and dewpoint are the same. The lowest is between 800 and 700 millibars (we estimate 750 millibars). The second is between 700 and 600 millibars (we estimate 650 millibars). The third is at about 500 millibars. We would expect clouds to form at these altitudes.  "

The pressure readings correspond to altitudes (height) which we tend to think of as up. Putting this on the y-axis matches this expectation.  Why do the y-axis labels decrease as they go up?  Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, so low pressure means higher altitude. The pressure readings are arranged to be low altitude at the bottom and high altitude at the top.  Why do the inputs begin at 1000?  Because the pressure readings correspond to altitude the highest pressure should be on the ground. It turns out 1013 is a typical pressure at ground level, so much higher pressure readings are not expected.  Why are the output labels from -100 to 40?  These are based on commonly experienced temperatures. Temperatures lower than -100 C are not expected. Temperatures above 40 C do occur, but not in the location where this sounding was taken.  Use to convert 50 C to Fahrenheit to see why this temperature is uncommon in most locations.  "

  "title": "Identifying Rates",
  "body": " Identifying Rates   This section addresses the following topics.  Interpret data in various formats and analyze mathematical models  This section covers the following mathematical concepts.  Identify rates as linear, quadratic, exponential, or other (critical thinking)    So far we have looked at linear models. We will add quadratic, exponential, and some variations in later sections. One of the ways we distinguish between models is by the rate at which they grow. Often the rate at which something is happening is more important than how much there currently is. This section presents two methods for identifying rates from tables of data. How to identify each type by graph is presented in the appropriate chapter and section.    Differences  One way to measure rates is to look at the differences between data points. Calculating these differences is illustrated in the table below.   Tien's Salary   Tien's Salary  Year  Salary  Difference   2017  $52,429.33    2018  $55,050.80  $55,050.80-$52,429.33=$2,621.47   2019  $57,803.34  $57,803.34-$55,050.80=$2,752.54   2020  $60,693.50  $60,693.50-$57,803.34=$2,890.17   2021  $63,728.18  $63,728.18-$60,693.50=$3,034.68   2022  $66,914.59  $66,914.59-$63,728.18=$3,186.41   2023  $70,260.32  $70,260.32-$66,914.59=$3,345.73   2024  $73,773.33  $73,773.33-$70,260.32=$3,513.02     In order to see how these differences can help us distinguish between linear and other models, consider Vasya's salary in . We know that the difference between each year's salary is $5000.00, because we are told that was the raise each year. This is linear model. In contrast Tien's raises are different each year (they grow year to year). This means his salary does not grow linearly.   Differences for Atmospheric Pressure Model  Consider the model in . calculates the differences every 2000 ft. Notice that the differences are all the same namely -2.00. This model is linear.  calculates the differences every 1000 ft. In this table the differences are all -1.00. This still indicates that the model is linear. It does not matter what interval we choose. If the differences over evenly spaced intervals are the same, then the model is linear.  The differences we obtained do match. Consider . When written as a ratio the differences are the same number.    Atmospheric Pressure Differences (2000 ft intervals)   Altitude (ft MSL)  Expected Pressure (inHg)  Difference   0  29.92    2000  27.92  27.92-29.92=-2.00   4000  25.92  25.92-27.92=-2.00   6000  23.92  23.92-25.92=-2.00   8000  21.92  21.92-23.92=-2.00      Atmospheric Pressure Differences (1000 ft intervals)   Altitude (ft MSL)  Expected Pressure (inHg)  Difference   0  29.92    1000  28.92  28.92-29.92=-1.00   2000  27.92  27.92-28.92=-1.00   3000  26.92  26.92-27.92=-1.00   4000  25.92  25.92-26.92=-1.00      Linear Relation  A relation is linear if and only if the rate of change is constant.   This states that a linear model grows by the same amount from one step to the next (rate of change or difference). This equal growth results from the ratio in the form . Consider the specific case . In the table below notice that the differences are all the same and that the difference is 3. 3 is the ratio from the equation. This is always the case. The slope is how fast the line grows.   Differences for Lines     Difference       5-2=3    8-5=3    11-8=3    14-11=3    Note we used this constant addition property when working with ratio problems like . Relations defined by fixed ratios like these are linear.  For linear data consecutive differences are always the same. The next examples ( to ) illustrate known, non-linear data and how the differences for those look.   Quadratic Data  Consider . The first differences (what we calculated above) are not the same. Thus this data is not linear.  However, the first differences increase in a suspiciously simple pattern. Checking the second differences (the differences of the 1st differences) we see a linear pattern. This turns out to be the pattern for all quadratic data.    Quadratic Data     1st difference  2nd difference   1  1   2  4  4-1=3   3  9  9-4=5  5-3=2   4  16  16-9=7  7-5=2   5  25  25-16=9  9-7=2   6  36  36-25=11  11-9=2      Quadratic Relation  A relation is quadratic if and only if the second differences are constant.    Exponential Data  Consider . The differences are not the same nor do they show the same pattern of quadratics. However, there is a pattern in the differences. Notice that the differences are exactly equal to the original data. This means that the rate of increase is determined by the current scale. In other words, the bigger it is, the faster it grows. This is the pattern of data that varies exponentially.    Exponential Data     Difference   1  2   2  4  4-2=2   3  8  8-4=4   4  16  16-8=8   5  32  32-16=16   6  64  64-32=32     The next example illustrates that the differences for exponential data are not always exactly equal to the data.   Exponential Data Differences   Consider . The differences are not exactly equal to the original numbers. However, notice that  , and . The differences are double the original numbers. In general for exponential data the differences will be the original data scaled by some number.  Happily there is an easier way to determine that data is exponential shown in the next section.     Exponential Data with Scale     Difference   1  3   2  9  9-3=6   3  27  27-9=18   4  81  81-27=54   5  243  243-81=162   6  729  729-243=486      Exponential Relation  A relation is exponential if and only if the differences are a multiple of the original values, that is the rate is proportional to the value.     Quotients  The previous section analyzed change as the difference (subtraction) of consecutive numbers (salaries in these examples). This section analyzes change using the percent increase for each pair of consecutive numbers.   Salary Percent Incease  We will first calculate the percent increase of salary each year for Tien and Vasya. Because salary numbers are exact, we will not use significant digits. Rather we will round to the nearest percent. This is in and .  Notice that for Tien the percent increase is the same each year. It is 5%. For Vasya, the percent increase is not the same each year. How does the percent increase change for her?    Percent Increase for Tien   Year  Ratio   Increase   2018  $55,050.80\/$52,429.33  =1.05  5%   2019  $57,803.34\/$55,050.80  =1.05 5%   2020  $60,693.50\/$57,803.34  =1.05 5%   2021  $63,728.18\/$60,693.50  =1.05 5%      Percent Increase for Vasya   Year  Ratio   Increase   2018  $67,347.23\/$62,347.23  =1.08 8%   2019  $72,347.23\/$67,347.23  =1.07  7%   2020  $77,347.23\/$72,347.23  =1.07  7%   2021  $82,347.23\/$77,347.23  =1.06  6%      Exponential  A relation is exponential if and only if the percent increase is constant.    The table below gives an amount of caffeine in the blood stream. This data is exponential with a ratio of 0.87. This ratio means there is a 13% decrease per hour of caffeine in the blood stream per hour in this example. This is in contrast to the previous example which was an increasing exponential.   Hour  Caffeine  Ratio   0  95 mg    1  83 mg    2  72 mg    3  63 mg    4  55 mg    5  48 mg    6  41 mg    7  36 mg    8  31 mg      Although and are phrased differently they both accurately describe exponential relations. Generally it is easier to test if data is exponential by testing the ratios of terms rather than the differences. shows an example of analyzing data using both differences and ratios. Notice that the differences are a scaled version of the original data (scaled by ). The ratio from the quotient is which gives about a 33% increase. For the curious the data was generate by .   Exponential Data 2 Ways   Data  Difference  Ratio                             Subtract consecutive pairs of salaries. If all the differences are the same, then that person's raises were linear. If not linear, divide consecutive pairs. If all the ratios are the same, then that person's raises were exponential.

  "body": " Variation   This section addresses the following topics.  Interpret data in various formats and analyze mathematical models  Read and use mathematical models in a technical document  This section covers the following mathematical concepts.  Identify rates as linear, quadratic, exponential, or other (critical thinking)  Identify data varrying directly or indirectly (critical thinking)  Solve linear, rational, quadratic, and exponential equations and formulas (skill)    presents how to determine the rate at which one variable grows with respect to another. In all of those cases we considered only one variable changing. However, many models have more than one variable or parameter, and we wish to analyze the impact each one has on the result. This section will also present one more type of rate.    Analyzing Models with Multiple Variables  This first example illustrates how a result can be linear with respect to one or more variables and quadratic (or other relationships) with another.   Review . Consider how lift changes with respect to each of the parameters.  Consider the density of air. If the other parameters remain constant (only density changes), then the model looks like We can see that lift ( ) changes linearly with respect to air density ( ).  Consider the surface area of the airfoil (wing or propeller). If the other parameters remain constant (only surface area changes), then the model looks like We can see that lift ( ) changes linearly with respect to surface area ( ).  Consider the coefficient of lift of the airfoil. If the other parameters remain constant, then the model looks like We can see that lift ( ) changes linearly with respect to the coefficient of lift ( ).  Consider the velocity. If the other parameters remain constant, then the model looks like We can see that lift ( ) changes quadratically with respect to velocity ( ).  How can we apply this knowledge? Lift changes linearly with respect to all parameters except for velocity. If greater lift (to handle greater weight) is needed, velocity provides bigger bang for our buck than any other change.   This second example has us look at the impact on more than just one variable. It also introduces a new relationship.   Review .  First consider the impact temperature ( ) has on pressure ( ). If the other parameters remain constant, then the model looks like Pressure ( ) grows linearly with respect to temperature.  Notice that we can write that last equation at which means we can also make the reverse statement: temperature increases linearly with pressure.  Next consider the impact temperature ( ) has on volume ( ). If the other parameters remain constant, then the model looks like Volume ( ) also grows linearly with respect to temperature.  Finally consider the impact volume ( ) has on pressure ( ). If the other parameters remain constant, then the model looks like This pattern is not linear (nor quadratic, nor exponential). If volume is increased the right hand side will decrease (dividing by a larger number). This means that pressure will decrease. Conversely if volume is decreased the right hand side will increase (divide by a smaller number). This means that pressure will increase.    Vary Directly   For two quantities and , if increasing increases , then is said to vary directly with .     Vary Indirectly   For two quantities and , if increasing decreases , then is said to vary indirectly with .    illustrated a model where the increase in one variable caused a decrease in the other. We used an experiment (plugging in numbers) to discover the inverse relationship.  If two quantities vary directly, the model may be linear or quadratic. If two quantities vary inversely, the model may be neither linear nor quadratic. In contrast the next example illustrates two quantities can vary inversely, and the model is still exponential.   Decreasing Exponential  Review the data in the table below. First, notice that decreases as increases which means varies inversely with . Second, note that the data is exponential with a ratio of . All exponential models that are decreasing have this property.     Ratio   1  1\/2   2  1\/4  1\/2   3  1\/8  1\/2   4  1\/16  1\/2   5  1\/32  1\/2   6  1\/64  1\/2       More Model Usage  In the section above and in we determined growth rates (e.g., linear, quadratic exponential, and direct and inverse variation) by generating data and checking the consecutive differences and\/or the consecutive ratios. In this section we learn a method to directly calculate the relationship.   Pressure is a measure of the amount of force spread over an area. where  is pressure,  is the force in units of pounds (lbs) or Newtons (N),  is the area in units of square inches, or meters, or similar.     Walking on snow (or mud) is difficult because our feet tend to puncture the snow. We can use snowshoes to avoid this problem. The reduction in pressure is the reason snowshoes work.  Suppose Guido weighs 172 lbs. Each foot has an area of 22 . The pressure he exerts on the snow is If he wears snowshoes that have a surface area of 144 , what is the pressure? Note because this is a science model, we use significant digits for rounding.   The next example illustrates how we can construct another model when we are interested in only some of the variables.   Hydraulic Press     Hydraulics  Consider the situation in . The pressure exerted on a fluid by a piston is the ratio of the force exerted and the area of the piston. On the left that is . The same is true on the right . Because the hydraulic fluid is contiguous the pressure is the same on both sides. Thus .    If the left piston has area , and 5.0 N of force is exerted, what is the force exerted on the second piston if it has area ?  Notice this is a proportion problem. We can use the relationship   The next example illustrates how we can determine how one variable varies with respect to another by direct calculation. Specifically, consider how changing the size of the second piston affects the resulting force.   If the second piston's area is changed from to , what is the increase or decrease in force?  First we setup the same problem as in   The piston is larger and the force is also larger. Thus we know that force and area vary directly. Note the equation also shows us that they increase linearly, because all terms are linear. In particular is in the form of a line with ratio and no shift.    gives two forms of the ideal gas law. The second is produced from the first in the same way as the hydraulics model is produced from the pressure definition. To illustrate consider the case of the air\/water mixture in a pressure cooker. First recall the ideal gas law . The pressure cooker changes the temperature of the gas, but the volume, number of molecules and gas constant do not change. Thus we have and . In both cases we can solve for the shared variables. Note Similarly . Because both expressions equal we can set them equal giving which is the other model.  The example above produces a second form of the ideal gas law. This example produces a second form of Ohm's Law. In many applications the voltage is fixed. For example it might be 12V from a car battery. Thus if we are considering current and resistance in two places we have and . Because voltage is the same (same source of electricity) we have .   If the current is 3 amps when the resistance is 8 Ohms, what will the current be when the resistance is 6 Ohms? 4 Ohms?   We can write The second case can be written  Notice as the resistance decreased, the current increased. Current varies inversely with resistance.      Limitations of Models  In we solved the model equation to see how one value changes with respect to another. We considered how temperature impacts pressure if the other properties do not change. We also considered how temperature impacts volume if the other properties do not change. We might ask how how volume impacts temperature if the other properties do not change.  We will not however, because this is impossible. If volume is reduced (e.g., we press down on the handle of a tire pump and do not let the air out), then the pressure will increase. There is no way around that. The increase of pressure will then result in an increase of temperature. This still matches the model we have.  When using a model, mathematics is used to understand what is meant, but we must understand some of the background so we do not draw false conclusions.

Solve linear, rational, quadratic, and exponential equations and formulas (skill)    This section presents algebra needed to work with models involving more complex, rational (fractional) expressions; and it presents how to answer questions requiring adding rates.    Re-arranging Rational Expressions  In previous sections many of the models involving rational (fractional) expressions could be set up so we solved for a variable in the numerator. In this section we look at multiple examples in which we must solve for a variable in the denominator.   Gear Design   For ANSI standard gears there is a relationship between the number of teeth, and diameters of the gear. where  is the total number of teeth  the diameter of the outside of the gear, and  is the pitch diameter.  Note pitch diameter is the diameter of a circle such that this where this gear meets the other gear.     Suppose we know the outer diameter (17\/8\") and pitch diameter (2\") needed for a gear. What are the steps to solve for the number of teeth?  Using the model we obtain Thus this gear will have 32 teeth (total).    Formula for Number of Teeth  If we are going to perform this calculation regularly, we can solve the equation for .   Notice we needed to collect the terms with . This required distributing (third line), collecting on one side, then factoring.    Pitch Diamter    A problem with similar algebra is the when we are solving for temperature. The next example illustrates the necessary algebra.   Suppose the conditions for a tire are psi at a temperature of F. At what temperature will the pressure drop below the safe value of 28 psi?  We can use the ideal gas law version below. Note that the volume does not change (the tire size does not change).    The final example in this section presents a type of problem involving adding multiple fractions. This is needed for the resistors in parallel problem and is connected to the next section on additive rates.   Parallel Resistors   When two resistors are in parallel as shown in then the resulting resistance is given by .  If there are more than two resistors, the model is expanded by adding an additional term for each resistor.     Resistors in Parallel    The primary algebra technique required is to obtain common denominators.   Parallel Resistance  Calculate the resulting resistance when one resistor is 4 Ohms ( ) and the other is 12 Ohms ( ).  Note the need for a common denominator in the third line. The final step is our now frequently used clearing of denominators (i.e., cross multiplication ).    Parallel Resistance Solving  In the previous example we knew the two resistors and calculated the resulting resistance. In other cases we know how much resistance we need and one of the resistors. We must calculate the resistance for the other resistor.  If we need a 5.0 Ohm resistance and have an 8.0 Ohm resistor already, what do we add as the second resistor? Due to common accuracy of resistor measurement we can use two significant digits.  Note the need for a common denominator in the fourth line. The final step is once again clearing of denominators (i.e., cross multiplication ).    Parallel Resistance Solving      If we need 5 Ohm resistance and one of our resistors is a 4 Ohm resistor, can we find a second resistor to make this work? Explain.    Rates  There are many times when we need to calculate the rate at which something can be accomplished when more than one person\/thing is working on it. This section illustrates how to obtain a resulting rate from the individual rates. This process requires algebra similar to that above.   Joint Work: Draining Basement  A company has two pumps available for draining flooded basements. One pump can drain a basement in 4.0 hours, whereas the other pump can do the job in only 3.0 hours. How long would it take to drain the basement if both pumps are used simulataneously?  The question is how to find the speed of the combined pumps. Adding a pump would increase the speed; we want to find a way to add the speeds. We can start by writing down the rates to see what that suggests. The first pump operates at a rate of and the second pump operates at a rate of . Because rates are ratios (fractions), and the units match, we know how to add them. The combined rate is . Notice in the last line that we have converted the rates from being the same number of basements to the same number of hours. We converted rates to a form that was easier to use.  The next step is to use this rate to determine how long it takes to empty one basement. This means scaling this rate from 7 basements per 12 hours to 1 basement per N hours which is a proportion. Given this is in hours it makes sense to round to the hundreds (a little less than a minute). Because it is how long it will take it makes sense to round up. We expect the two pumps to complete the work in 1.72 hours (a little less than 1 hour and 45 minutes).  Because the denominator was 1 basement, when we cleared the denominator (cross multiplication) all we did was adjust the units (basement\/basement divides out). This suggests we could have simply scaled the combined rate to obtain the final result. . Thus if both pumps are working it will take 1.72 hours drain the basement.  The increase in speed, results in less time required to complete the job. This is why the faster rate (1 basement per 1.72 hours) has a smaller denominator (1.72 vs 3 or 4).    How to Use an Example: Joint Work  If one housekeeper can clean a hotel room in 11 minutes, and another can clean a room in 13 minutes. How long will it take them combined to clean 27 rooms?  Because the question asks us to determine combined speed, we recognize this as a joint work problem. Looking at we see that the first step was to write down the two rates. and .  After writing the rates, we realize we need to add the rates.  After calculating the rate, the next step was setting up the proportion. In this case we want to find the time to clean 27 rooms. Because this is about the time required to complete a task it makes sense to round up to 141 minutes.     "

  "body": " Linear Systems   In we wanted to solve a problem with two constraints. We could meet one exactly (percent alcohol) and the other in inequality (at least that volume). Many problems have more than one constraint (condition we want to meet). Here we will learn to solve one type of them.    Motivation  In previous dilution problems we diluted a mixture using just diluent (water in that case). In other situations we will have two mixtures and want to combine them.   Combining Mixtures  Suppose we have 16 oz of 91% isopropyl alcohol and 12 oz of 75% isopropyl alcohol. How much of each do we need to mix to produce oz of 85% alcohol?  A common technique in mathematics is to start by writing the answer. We will declare that we will use oz of 91% alcohol and oz of 75% alcohol. Next we will express our dual constraints using these answers (variables).  The first constraint is that we end up with 10 oz of solution. Thus  The second contraint is the percent alcohol. Because it will be 85% alcohol there will be . Because oz of the first solution will be added and it is 91% alcohol, it will contribute oz of alcohol. Similarly the second solution will contribute oz of alcohol. Combined we will obtain  Now we just need a way to solve this pair of equations.     Crossing Lines  Our goal here is to consider what causes lines to cross. We will do this by looking at a pair of lines and seeing where they cross.  Recall that a line is a relation (set of points) such that the change between any two, equally space points is the same. Often you have heard this described as rise over run or slope. Slope is a geometric interpretation referring to how steep the line is.   Suppose we start at a point . If we know that the line increases 2 units for each step then the points and are also on the line. This shows us that for each x value we add 2. This gives us because that adds two for each x. But we must account for starting at . so we need to add one to shift it up. This is why the line is . This is the slope-intercept form of a line. The coefficient of x, 2 in this case, tells us how steep (how much it goes up for each incease of x). The constant, 1 in this case, shifts the line up or down.   In there are two lines. One goes through point . It rises at a slope of (two up for each one over). The other line goes through the point which is below . Use the slider to set the slope of the second line to 3. Does the line cross the one through ? Where (left or right of point )? Use the slider to set the slope to something bigger than 3. Does the line cross the first one? Where (left or right of point )? Use the slider to set the slope to 1. Does the line cross the first one? Where (left or right of point )? In general if one slope is steeper than the other will they cross? Can you select a slope so that they don't cross?   Crossing Lines    Vasya's initial pay was $62,347.23. She received $5,000 raises each year. Pyotr's initial pay was $67,242.33. He receives $3,500 raises each year. If they were both hired in 2012 in what year does Vasya first have a higher salary? We could make a table.   Year  Vasya  Pyotr   2012  $62,347.23  $67,242.33   2013  $67,347.23  $70,742.33   2014  $72,347.23  $74,242.33   2015  $77,347.23  $77,742.33   2016  $82,347.23  $81,242.33    We see that is in 2016 that Vasya is first paid more. We could note that Vasya's raises are $1,500 more each year than Pyotr's raises. This means she closes the gap by $1,500 each year. The difference in their initial salaries is . Because she gains by 1500 each year it will take years. Because they receive raises once a year it will take 4 years. Thus she is first paid more in 2016.    Solving Linear Systems  We will consider two ways of solving linear systems of this type. The second method is very important for larger systems.   We will solve the system from . The two equations are   Notice we can solve the first equation for , then substitute it into the second. Now that we know that we can substitute that into This gives us  We can check that this works in the other equation (about percent alcohol).    If we had 7 variables instead of two, substituting would take a while. Instead we can use the following method which is more like solving as we know it, that is isolating a variable. We call it elimination .   We will solve the system  Note how we modify the first equation to partially match the second one. In the fifth line we added the two equations. Because they had opposite coefficients for , that was eliminated leaving us with just . This can always be done with systems of linear equations.     Solve the linear system below using substitution.                  We can solve the first equation for and substitute.           Solve the linear system below using elimination.                  We note that so we should multiply the first equation by -2.          Find the solution to this system.                  To eliminate the term we need to multiply the equation by          Other Cases  In we found a slope that caused no intersection. If we were solving a pair of linear equations that represented lines like this we would find no solution. These are known as inconsistent systems.   Inconsistent Linear System  Find all solutions to the system   We will use elimination. If we multiply -2 by the first equation we will obtain -4 (opposite of x in the second equation). Our work is correct, but the conclusion is clearly false. This means there are no solutions. You can think of this as saying, for a solution to exist 0 must equal -3.   There is a third case.   Dependent System  Find all solutions to the system   We will use elimination. If we multiply -2 by the first equation we will obtain -4 (opposite of x in the second equation). This time we have a true, but rather uninformative statement. We notice that after scaling (multiplying by -2) the two equations were identical. Essentially we had only one equation. Because one can be obtained from the other we call them dependent .     Determine whether this system is inconsistent or dependent.   The system is   Inconsistent    Dependent                Two Equations  Two Equations  Two Equations  Two Equations  Two Equations  Two Equations  Two Equations  Two Equations  Two Equations  Linear System Application  Linear System Application  Linear System Application  Linear System Application  Linear System Application  Linear System Application  Linear System Application  Linear System Application   "

Each question is worth I DONT KNOW points.  In we learned to calculate percents for mixtures and how to dilute a mixture to a specified percent.  By adding water we can of course not increase the percent alcohol, so if we start with 91% alcohol 91% is the highest we can achieve. On the other side we can reduce the percent alcohol to as little as we want (not quite to 0%) if we dilute it enough. This dilution requires not restricting the final volume. This pair of restrictions should make us wonder about a relationship between the desired volume and the minimum\/maximum amount of alchol.  For all of these questions start with 16 oz of 91.0% alcohol solution.   This first question is the same as . Use it to review the basic dilution calculation. Suppose you have 16 oz of 91.0% alcohol solution. How much water must we add to obtain at least 20.0 oz of 70.0% alcohol solution? How many ounces is the resulting solution?   Next we will illustrate that for a percent alcohol such as 70%, there is a maximum volume we can achieve. Specifically this is the number we already calculated.  If we dilute to a 70.0% alcohol solution what is the resulting amount of solution? You calculate this above. Add one ounce of water. Calculate the resulting percent alcohol. Did the percent alcohol decrease, stay the same, or increase? As a result can we produce more 70.0% alcohol solution starting with 16.0 oz of 91.0% alcohol?  Note, if we added less water we would have less solution, so that is a decrease (not the maximum).    Next, we ask at what rate does the maximum percent alcohol increase or decrease as we increase the desired amount of solution.

What is the resulting percent alcohol? How much water must be added for 22 oz of solution? What is the resulting percent alcohol? How much water must be added for 24 oz of solution? What is the resulting percent alcohol? Does the maximum percent alcohol increase or decrease with the increase in the number of ounces? Does it grow linearly, quadratically, exponentially, or otherwise?   We can ask this question in reverse as well. If we want a percent alcohol, what is the resulting maximum amount of resulting solution? Then we measure the growth of the amount.  Once again we start with 16.0 oz of 91.0% alcohol solution.  If we want exactly 80.0% alcohol, what is the resulting volume of solution? If we want exactly 70.0% alcohol, what is the resulting volume of solution?

  "body": " Project: Radiation Dosage   Calculating Effects of Radiation   The purpose of this project is to build a mathematical model for a situation. We will focus on the structure of the equations, and what they tell us about the mathematical relationships of the data. The emphasis is not on actual numbers.  For an unrelated example of a model, consider dropping a ball off a cliff. Ignoring air resistance, the ball’s position can be modeled by the equation , where is the time and is the height of the ball. There are some other numbers that go in there, but what is changing is the time and position (height). That equation framework is the mathematical model.  You may find this to be a challenging project. Do the best you can and use your own common sense. Math should make sense! After you finish this, please read back over your work and make sure your answers are logically consistent.  Remember that you can ask questions and meet up with a tutor, but you should not be looking up answers or just writing down what someone else says. Do not let someone else copy your answers. That is academic dishonesty and you should not allow it. Your work should be your own.  For this project, imagine that you are working with radioactive material. Since we do not want you harmed by radiation, we should understand how time and distance impacts the radioactive dose. (You should also be behind material that shields you from the radiation, but that math is more complicated, so we’ll focus on time and distance.)   As your time near a radioactive source increases, does the radiation level in your body increase, decrease, or stay the same?  Do you think the relationship between time and dosage is linear or not linear?  Let stand for radiation exposure, stand for length of time of exposure, and be the constant of variation. Write an equation representing the relationship between , , and .  Examine the above equation you just wrote.  Is it linear or non-linear? This should match your answer to .  What in the equation indicates it is linear or non-linear? That is, how did you know the answer to part ?    We have determined the relation between time and radiation exposure. Next we determine the relation between distance to radiation source and radiation exposure. These can be different.  Radiation radiates outwards from a source evenly in all directions (like light radiates out evenly from a lightbulb) unless it is obstructed by something (like a lead shield). Imagine a radiation source floating in the center of a sphere. All parts of the sphere would be getting hit with an equal amount of radiation. We are going to figure out the radiation for a given patch of area on this sphere.  It will be helpful to know the following formula: , where A is the surface area of the sphere and r is the radius of the sphere.  If a sphere had a radius of 2 m, what is the surface area of the sphere? Remember to include units. Leave your answer in terms of (meaning it should look like  ).  A very rough approximation of the surface area of the front of a person is 1 . We will consider what percent of the surface area of a sphere this is.   Surface Area Ratio       What percent of the surface area of a sphere of radius 1 is 1 ?   What percent of the surface area of a sphere of radius 2 is 1 ?   Why does the change in percent make sense? See .   In general as the radius increases what will the percent of the surface that is 1 do? Increase\/remain the same\/decrease?   Note that the amount of radiation (energy) remains the same regardless of the radius of the sphere. That is a sphere with radius 1 and surface area has the same energy as a sphere with radius 2 and surface area .  If the radiation is being emitted at an intensity of Sieverts per hour ( ), what amount of radiation will be hitting our 1 person who is at a distance of 1 from the source?   If the radiation is being emitted at an intensity of Sieverts per hour ( ), what amount of radiation will be hitting our 1 person who is at a distance of 2 from the source?   In general as the distance (radius) increases what happens to the amount of radiation absorbed by the person do? Increase\/remain the same\/decrease?    If the radiation is being emitted at an intensity of Sieverts per hour ( ), what amount of radiation will be hitting our human-sized cutout on the surface of the sphere? Your answer should be in terms of .  Complete the following table. Notice that you already found the values for the first row.   Ratio of Surface Areas      Radius of circle Ratio of 1 to surface area  2  3  4  5  r    Graph the points in . Your horizontal axis (radius) should be from 0 to 5. Because the output numbers are small, we need a scale that matches. Make the units on the vertical scale 0.002.  Does the data represented in the table above represent a linear relationship or a non-linear relationship? Give a reason to justify your answer.  Is the relationship between distance and the potential amount of radiation hitting the person better modeled by direct variation or inverse variation?  Consider the numbers 16, 36, 64, 100. These numbers are significant in mathematics. What is the pattern or significance of these numbers? (Note: you only see these numbers if you completed the table in terms of (do not multiply and round). Go back and fix your table if you do not see these numbers.)  As the radius of the sphere increases, does the level of radiation hitting our person-sized cutout increase or decrease? Does this increase or decrease change linearly (at a constant rate) or non-linearly (at a changing rate)? Circle the appropriate answer.  As the radius of the sphere increases, the radiation intensity is increasing \/ decreasing (circle one) in a linear \/ non-linear (circle one) fashion.  The sphere with a floating radiation source is a good model for us to use when thinking through how distance impacts radiation levels because we can disregard complicating factors like the walls, floor, and ceiling of the room as long as a person is still directly exposed to the radiation source. Still, the relationship you found between radius and radiation holds true. With that in mind, answer the following questions.  Let stand for radiation experienced by the person, stand for distance, and be the constant of variation. Write an equation of variation representing the relationship between , and . Look back at your recent answers and the table you built. Is the formula you wrote logically consistent with these answers? That is, if you plugged in the with some constant value , would you get the right answer for ?  Let stand for radiation exposure, stand for length of time of exposure, stand for distance, and be the constant of variation (this may be different from your in or ). Write an equation of joint variation representing the relationship between , and . Is your answer consistent with your answers to #3 and #13?  Use the equation you just built. If you are 5 meters away for 3 hours, how long would you stay at 2 meters away to receive the same radiation dose?  At the end of it all, if you find yourself next to a radioactive source, what do you do? Full points will be awarded for all reasonable answers that address both time and distance.   "

Note that the amount of radiation (energy) remains the same regardless of the radius of the sphere. That is a sphere with radius 1 and surface area has the same energy as a sphere with radius 2 and surface area .  If the radiation is being emitted at an intensity of Sieverts per hour ( ), what amount of radiation will be hitting our 1 person who is at a distance of 1 from the source?   If the radiation is being emitted at an intensity of Sieverts per hour ( ), what amount of radiation will be hitting our 1 person who is at a distance of 2 from the source?   In general as the distance (radius) increases what happens to the amount of radiation absorbed by the person do? Increase\/remain the same\/decrease?    If the radiation is being emitted at an intensity of Sieverts per hour ( ), what amount of radiation will be hitting our human-sized cutout on the surface of the sphere? Your answer should be in terms of .  Complete the following table. Notice that you already found the values for the first row.   Ratio of Surface Areas      Radius of circle Ratio of 1 to surface area  2  3  4  5  r    Graph the points in . Your horizontal axis (radius) should be from 0 to 5. Because the output numbers are small, we need a scale that matches. Make the units on the vertical scale 0.002.  Does the data represented in the table above represent a linear relationship or a non-linear relationship? Give a reason to justify your answer.  Is the relationship between distance and the potential amount of radiation hitting the person better modeled by direct variation or inverse variation?  Consider the numbers 16, 36, 64, 100. These numbers are significant in mathematics. What is the pattern or significance of these numbers? (Note: you only see these numbers if you completed the table in terms of (do not multiply and round). Go back and fix your table if you do not see these numbers.)  As the radius of the sphere increases, does the level of radiation hitting our person-sized cutout increase or decrease? Does this increase or decrease change linearly (at a constant rate) or non-linearly (at a changing rate)? Circle the appropriate answer.  As the radius of the sphere increases, the radiation intensity is increasing \/ decreasing (circle one) in a linear \/ non-linear (circle one) fashion.  The sphere with a floating radiation source is a good model for us to use when thinking through how distance impacts radiation levels because we can disregard complicating factors like the walls, floor, and ceiling of the room as long as a person is still directly exposed to the radiation source. Still, the relationship you found between radius and radiation holds true. With that in mind, answer the following questions.  Let stand for radiation experienced by the person, stand for distance, and be the constant of variation. Write an equation of variation representing the relationship between , and . Look back at your recent answers and the table you built. Is the formula you wrote logically consistent with these answers? That is, if you plugged in the with some constant value , would you get the right answer for ?  Let stand for radiation exposure, stand for length of time of exposure, stand for distance, and be the constant of variation (this may be different from your in or ). Write an equation of joint variation representing the relationship between , and . Is your answer consistent with your answers to #3 and #13?  Use the equation you just built. If you are 5 meters away for 3 hours, how long would you stay at 2 meters away to receive the same radiation dose?  At the end of it all, if you find yourself next to a radioactive source, what do you do? Full points will be awarded for all reasonable answers that address both time and distance.  "

  "body": " Geometric Reasoning   Here we will use a variety of formulas for geometric properties on basic shapes to analyze objects in context and more complicated shapes. These formulas are provided (largely) without explanation. Our goal is to break down complex problems into simpler problems we can solve using these formulas on basic shapes.    Properties  Two of the properties of shapes we will consider are perimeter and area . The perimeter of a shape is a measure of the size of its border (edges). The area of a shape is a measure of what it takes to fill the shape.    2D Shapes   Parallelogram  A parallelogram is a four sided shape for which opposing pairs of sides are parallel.   Note this includes rectangles , which are parallelograms with four right angles, and rhombi which are parallelograms with four equal length sides. Notice that a square is a rectangle and a rhombus.   Parallelograms      Shape  Perimeter  Area           What are the perimeter and area of the parallelogram in ?   The perimeter is the sum of the sides which in this case is  The area of a parallelogram, given in is . For this parallelogram that is     Calculate the area    In the height is labeled . Where is another height that could be used?  What does equal in a rectangle?   Trapezoid  A trapezoid is a four sided shape for which one pair of opposing sides are parallel.    Trapezoid      Shape  Perimeter  Area          What are the perimeter and area of the trapezoid in ?   The perimeter of this trapezoid is the sum of the four side lengths .  The area of a trapezoid, given in is . For this trapezoid that is     Calculate the area     Triangle  A triangle is a three sided shape.    Triangle      Shape  Perimeter  Area         Note that the value in the area formula is called the height of the triangle. It is the length of a line segment perpendicularly down from a vertex to the opposing side (or extension of it). The vertical, dashed line segments in are heights for those two triangles. The one on the left is from the top vertex down to the bottom side. The one on the right is from the top vertex down to the extension (to the left) of the bottom side.   What are the perimeter and area of the triangles in ?   The perimeter of the triangle on the left is The perimeter of the triangle on the right is  The area of a triangle, given in is . For the triangle on the left that is  For the triangle on the right the area is     Calculate the area       In the height is labeled . Where are other possible heights and where are their bases?   Pythagorean Theorem  For a triangle containing a right angle where and are the lengths of the sides adjacent to the right angle and is the third side.    Consider the triangle on the right in . Consider the segments of length 4.43, 5.98, and the horizontal dashed segment. 5.98 is the length of the side not adjacent to the right angle ( in the formula). We can calculate the length of the horizontal, dashed segment using the formula.   In we will develop a version of this statement for triangles without a right angle.   Heron's Formula  The area of a triangle can be calculated using the three sides. where .    Calculate the area of the triangles in .  According to Heron's formula for the triangle on the left For the triangle on the right     Circle      Shape  Perimeter  Area              For a circle with radius 7.31 what are the perimeter and area?  The perimeter, given in , is . For radius 7.31 the perimeter is  The area, given in , is . For radius 7.31 the area is    What are the perimeter and area of a semi-circle with diameter 11.7?  The perimeter includes half the usual perimeter plus the length of the diameter.  The area is simply half of the usual area.     Applying Geometry  Our first task in using geometry properties is to break down a problem into the kinds of shapes we already know. Then we can use the properties to calculate results.   Find the area of this wall given the dimensions given in feet.  First we note that we can describe the wall as a rectangle with a triangle on top of it.  The sides of the rectangle area are 7 ft (height) and 24 ft (width). This means that area is .  The top is a triangle with two sides of length 13 and one of length 24. We don't know the height of the triangle so it will be easier to use Heron's formula for area. The total area then is square feet.  Find the perimeter of this wall given the dimensions given in feet. There are five (5) edges. There sum is feet.  What is the (tallest) height of the wall? We need the height of the triangular portion of the wall to find the height at the peak. Height is part of the area formula, and from Heron's formula we already know the height. The total height is then .    Wall      Katie is building a large scale abacus for a park. Her plan is to build it from treated 2x4 lumber. Her plan is shown in Note the depth of each piece of wood is 3.5\". If you are wondering why a 2x4 is 1.5 in x 3.5 in, note that the nominal size (2x4 in this case) is based on the initial cut. The lumber shrinks as it cures and again when it is planed smooth.  Because we must have enough wood, we will round up all approximations.    What is the total number of feet of lumber (2x4) needed?   There are two boards of length 60.0 inches and three boards of length 27.0 inches. The total length is . We convert this to feet using a ratio.    If a standard 2x4 is 96.0 inches long, what is the smallest number of boards Katie can purchase to have enough lumber?   If a 60.0 inch section is cut from a 96.0 inch board, we have left. This is long enough for one of the 27.0 inch segments but not more. Thus two board will cover all but the last 27.0 inch segment. We need 3, 96.0 inch boards.    If the boards are painted before they are assembled, what is the total surface area of the boards to be painted?   Each board has six surface. Each surface size appears twice (e.g., top and bottom). For the long segments these areas are For the short segments these are Thus the total area is This is .    What is the area that is hidden, that is, cannot be seen after assembling?   This would be where the three short boards touch the long boards. There are six places where this happens which are all the same shape . The covered surface is on both the short boards and the matching spot on the long boards, so there are 12 of these surfaces for .     Abacus    What is the total area of the birdhouse shown in ?

The volume of a 3D shape is a measure of what it takes to fill a 3D shape.    3D Shapes   Prism  A prism is a solid consisting of two identical polygons connected by parallelograms.   These look like a polygon has been extruded. If the sides are rectangles, then it is called a right prism . Prisms are named for their base shape. For example, there are triangular prisms and pentagonal prisms.   Prisms      Shape  Surface Area  Volume    sum of area of all sides       What is the surface area of the right triangular prism in ? The surface area consists of the areas of the three rectangles and the two right triangles. The rectangle areas are , , and . Because the triangles are right triangles, they both have area . The total area is .  What is the volume of the triangular prism in ? The volume is the area of the triangle, 3, times the height of the prism, 10. Thus the area is .    Calculate the surface area and volume     Cylinder  A cylinder is a circular prism.

You have been asked to bake the birthday cake of a little girl who is about to turn three. This little girl has been begging for weeks for a unicorn cake, and you decide to indulge her. When looking up suggestions online on how to bake this cake, you found that most everyone suggests baking the cake in smaller circular cake pans that have a diameter of 6 inches. That’s the best way to get the height for the unicorn head. A normal circular cake pan (and the only kind you have) has a diameter of 9 inches. You need to buy cake pans. As an experienced baker, you know that the recipe you are planning on using usually fills two regular (9-inch) cake pans, with a little room to spare. How many 6-inch pans do you need to buy? We’re going to assume all cake pans are the same height.  In this project, we will figure out how many 6 inch circular cake pans we’re going to need, assuming we’re sticking with the recipe we planned.  Instead of a traditional assignment where the questions guide you from step to step, this project has you practice your math solving skills from start to finish. You will demonstrate your ability to answer the question without any leading prompts. This will likely take you about a page or less.  You will be graded on the following.  Is your thought process clear? Are the steps laid out in a logical manner? If you used any formulas, did you write them down and label them? Don’t just race to the answer; set this up as if you are explaining it to someone else.  You need to show some calculations to justify your answer.  Some kind of written justification or explanation as to how you solved the problem. (Yes, use words!)  A clearly stated (and correct) answer.    How many 6-inch cake pans will you need to use to bake a unicorn cake, assuming you’re sticking with the original recipe?  We assumed all cake pans are the same height.

  "body": " Roots   In we solved expressions with quadratics using the square root. Here we will briefly describe roots in general including notation and their rate.    Definition of Roots  As implied by their use in solving square roots are an opposite concept to squares. For example means that 9 is the result of multiplying 3 by itself. means that 4 is a number that multiplied by itself is 16. This means in general .  There is one detail that we will not use, but should be acknowledged. Note that and . Thus might be considered to have two solutions. We saw this in . When solving using inversion as in we will ignore the negative solution which will not be useful in the problems asked.    Generalized Roots   Generalized Powers  Just as we can multiply a number by itself (e.g., ) we can multiply a number by itself more than once (e.g., ). In general   Evaluate each of these by multiplying enough times        Generalized Roots  Just as there are square roots to solve problems involving squares, there are roots for other powers as well. These are denoted with a small number to show which root. For example this is a third root: Just as with square roots we can use a device to calculate the values. The device may have a key like .  Another notation for roots is a type of exponent. For example, Likewise, This notation can be used when solving problems with powers.   Evaluate each of these using a device.          Rates of Roots  We have compared rates of linear, quadratic, and exponential data ( ). Here we learn about rates by considering the rate of roots.  To compare rates see . Notice that the rate is eventuallymuch slower than even a linear. Because a linear is slower than a linear it is also slower than a quadratic or exponential.   Rate Comparison: Linear and Square Root    With rates it is important to test if a slow growth rate is leveling off or not. We will show that a square root (and other roots) do not level off. Note in we can produce an arbitrarily large result from a square root. If it leveled off at some number like 2000, we would not have a result larger, but . We can do this for any possible height for leveling off.   Rate of a Square Root                        "

First we complete this table               Next we graph these points and sketch the graph through them.     Notice that there is a single point at the bottom from which the parabola grows upward to the left and upward to the right. This is known as the vertex . It is at (0,0) for this parabola.  Notice as well that the left and right sides are mirrors of each other. Specifically they are mirrored over the line through the vertex known as the line of symmetry .

  "body": " Exponential Relations   In we learned different ways data can change. These included linear, quadratic, exponential and inverse versions of these. Here we will look at more details of exponential relations.  For exponential relations we know that the differences (additive rate) is a multiple of the value ( ) and that the percent increase is constant ( ). Now we will learn to work with these relations in applications.    Comparing Growth Rates  In colloquial speech exponential is used to mean very fast . We are using a much more specific definition. Here we will see why we think of exponential as very fast. We will do this by comparing how fast exponential relations grow relative to linear, quadratic, and one new relation.  Consider the linear, quadratic, and exponential relations in , , and respectively. Because the differences for a linear relation are always the same, eventually the values are bigger than the change (e.g., 5,8,11 are all bigger than 3). For both quadratic and exponential data the bigger they are the faster they grow. The growth is not the same however.  For the quadratic relation the first differences are getting bigger (at a constant rate), but eventually they are less than the value (e.g., 6,10,14 are less than 8,18, and 32 respectively) just like the linears. For exponential relations, however, the rate of growth of the values is a multiple of the values, that is the rate of growth increases as quickly as the values do (e.g., the values are doubling and so are the differences). Because of this exponential growth will always outpace linear and quadratic eventually.

Notice that . This inequality is true of the other ratios. The ratios are becoming smaller; indeed they appear to be approaching 1. In , the ratios for an exponential relation are constant. This also shows us that exponential relations grow faster than linear relations.

It is not. In are the ratios for a relation known as factorial. Interestingly, the ratios giving the percent increase are linear. This is vaguely like quadratic relations where their differences are linear. As quadratic relations are faster growing than linear relations, so factorial relations are faster growing than exponential relations.

Based on experiments a new generation of bacteria are formed every 70 minutes. For a while we can assume the original bacteria remain. Thus the population growth is as shown in . Note that at 70 minutes the model supposes all 4000 cells divide producing 4000 new cells. Thus the total population is . This repeats every 70 minutes. Because the cells split into two cells, the population doubles (multiply by 2).   Growth of Lactobacilus Acidophilus   Minutes  0  70  140  210  Population  4000  8000  16000  32000  Added   4000  8000  16000    We can express this model in mathematical notation. Let's walk through how was constructed. The initial amount (information we are given) is . After 70 minutes these double: . After 140 minutes they double a second time: . After 210 minutes they double a third time: .  Generally if we know the number of minutes , then dividing by 70 tells us how many times cells have divided in two. We want to multiply the initial amount (4000 in this case) by two (double the population) for each of these. This gives us .   A new cat video is posted and 12 people view it. Every 4 days after they view it the number of people who see it triples. Write an equation to model the number of people who view it on a given day.  We can calculate the first few days results. The 4 days after the video is posted, there will be 36 views. The eighth day, there will be 108 views. Each day we multiply the result by 3. Note that the tripling occurs every four days we need to divide the number of days by 4 to determine how many times it has tripled. We multiply the original twelve by 3 to triple it. Thus the number of people viewing the video is   The bacteria bacillus megaterium grows exponentially. It forms a new generation every 25 minutes. Write an equation to model this grows supposing there are 30 g bacteria at the beginning.  Note that in general these types of exponential growth models look like where is the current population (or count), is the initial population (or count), and is the rate at which the population grows (e.g., doubles, triples).  To write the model (equation) we need to know an initial amount and the rate of increase or decrease.    Suppose we know that over a period of time a population of hares are growing exponentially. The initial population was 320 hares and they doubled every 200 days. Write the equation to model this population.    The initial population is . Because the rate is doubling, we know that . If we want the variable to be in units of days, we need to adjust for the 200 day period. This is accomplished by using . Note this means 200 gives doubling once ( ), and 400 gives doubling twice ( ).     We learned in that salaries increased by a fixed percent each year are exponential in nature. Now we can write a model for this and calculate results.   Tien's initial salary was $52,429.33. He received a 5% raise each year. What should Tien's salary be entering the sixth year?  Because the raise is a 5% increase, the percent is . The model then is where is the number of years since he was hired. Entering the sixth year would mean five raises. His salary would be    If Moses' salary after six raises was $72,311.54, and he received a 4% raise each year. What was his initial salary?  Because the raise is a 4% increase, the percent is . The model then is where is the number of years since he was hired, and is the initial salary. We can now solve for the initial salary. Note, because the salary would be rounded each year this might be off by a small amount, but not enough to matter for our curiosity.    We will calculate the percent increase given initial and final salaries. If Raven's initial salary was $53,242.17, and her salary at the end of 7 years was $67,368.33, what was her annual percentage increase?  The end of seven years means there have been six raises. From the two data points we know Thus her annual percentage increase was 4%. The full model is where is time in years.     Interpretation of Exponentials  There is more than one way to interpret the base (e.g., the 7 in ). When it is an integer like 2 ( ) or 3 ( ) it tells us that the data is doubling or tripling. When the base looks like 1.053 ( ) it tells us the percent increase. In this example this represents a 5.3% increase. Recall from that a 3% decrease is represented by . In an exponential model this would look like . Generally interpreted as a percent the exponential model is   Suppose where is the number of years. What is the annual percent increase?  We know that so this is a 3.2% increase.    Suppose where is the number of years. What is the annual percent decrease?  We know that so this is a 12% decrease.    Suppose . Is this increase or decrease and what is the percent increase\/decrease?  Because this is a percent increase. Thus this is a 3% increase.   Even when the exponential model is expressed in terms of fractions, we can determine the percent increase or decrease.   In the exponential model what is the percent increase or decrease?  We convert the fraction to decimal: 1.40. Because it is bigger than one it is a percent increase. Note , so this is a 40% increase.    In the exponential model what is the percent increase or decrease?  We convert the fraction to decimal: 0.975. Because it is less than one it is a percent decrease. Note , so this is a 2.5% decrease.   A common base for exponentials in many scientific models is . We can work with this base using calculation devices which will have an button or an function.   What is the percent increase or decrease for the exponential model ?  Just as with the fractions we convert to decimal. Note that we can also write the model . Do you see the difference? . Thus this is a percent increase of 2.02%.     In the model what is the percent increase or decrease (2 decimal places)?  It is a percent   Increase    Decrease   of             We calculate This is greater than one so it is a percent increase. The percent is 5.13          Calculate results for exponential relations.

  "body": " Graphs of Exponential Functions   We have learned how to identify exponential data ( ) and have learned to work with some exponential applications ( ). Here we will consider traits of graphs of exponential functions.    Shape of Exponentials  Our first examples are discrete data. One example is the number of views of a video per day. This can be 10 or 21 but never 21.3 (we are not considering the percent of a video viewed). contains a bar chart for exponential data.  First, we ask ourselves how we can identify discrete exponential relations from a graph, and consider how we should make graphs so the distinction between exponential growth and other growth is clear.  Compare the exponential data in to the quadratic data in . We know that the exponential grows faster than the quadratic from . What (if anything) makes it clear that the exponential data is growing faster? What (if anything) hides the faster rate of growth of the exponential?  We know that factorial data grows faster than exponential data. Repeat with the exponential and factorial graphs.   Bar Chart of Quadratic Data     Bar Chart of Exponential Data     Bar Chart of Factorial Data    We also have continuous exponential data that we can graph as curves.   Graph .   First we will generate a table of points with which to start.                       We can plot these points then sketch a curve smoothly through the points.     Describe the curve in . Don't try to remember mathematical terms. What we need is phrasing we can remember and use to sketch other exponential curves.  In we looked at exponentials as they increase which on all of these graphs is toward the right. Now we will consider the exponential going to the left.   In we determined that the amount of bacteria was modeled by . Initially ( ) there are 30 g of bacteria. Now we will calculate how much bacteria there was before this initial measurement.              We notice that the amount of bacteria decreases. More specifically we see that it is divided in half each time. This is in contrast to doubling each time as it grows.  We also notice that because it is divided in half, there is always some left. No matter how far back in time we go, there will always be some. This is part of all exponentials: rapid growth in one direction and a gentle decrease toward some amount (zero in this case) in the other direction.  The model measures the bacteria by weight in grams. This can always be cut in half. What reality constraint should we put on this model?   Radioactive substances are not stable. The radiation they give off is the result of the atoms breaking down into other substances. This means that the amount of the original substance decreases over time. It has been shown that this decrease is exponential. The rate of decay is expressed in half-life , the amount of time for the substance to be reduced by half.    Uranium-242 has a half-life of 16.8 minutes. Suppose we begin with g of uranium-242.   How much is left at times 16.8, 33.6, and 50.4 minutes? At time 0 we have g. At time 16.8 it will be half of the original which is g. At time 33.6 it will be reduced by half twice ( ). Thus there will be g. At time 50.4 it will be reduced by half three times ( ), so the amount remaining will be g.  Write a model for this decay. We can use the process from . The time in minutes is divided by the half-life 16.8 minutes. Because this is reducing by half the scale is .  Graph this model. We can use the points from the first task and the method from .   Notice the gentle decrease toward zero is to the right this time as opposed to the left in . That is because we are cutting in half each time instead of doubling.     Atenolol has a half life of 6-7 hours depending on patient factors. For this problem use a half life of 6 hours. Suppose Victor is prescribed mg\/day. If Victor takes his first 50 mg pill Monday morning, how much is still in his blood Tuesday morning at the same time?  Graph the amount of atenolol in his blood for the first day.        A day is 24 hours so there are times that the amount of the drug in the body will be reduced by half. Because the initial amount was mg the amount the next day is         Geometric Illustration of Half-Life      Transforming Exponential Functions  In we learned how to shift and stretch parabolas (graphs of quadratics). Those same transformations work on exponentials (and any other function).  Graph each of the following using the graph in .   "

  "body": " Logarithm Properties   Consider the two graphs in . Note they are the same data drawn with different scales. Write down coordinates for the first three points. Is it easier to be precise using the version on the left or the version on the right?  The graph on the left uses the typical (linear) scale. Specifically on both the x and y axes each tick represents the same difference (add 1 unit for each tick or 2 units for each label). The graph on the right is the same data using a logarithmic scale. The x axis is still linear (same as the left), but the y axes is labeled such that each tick is the same product (multiply by 10 for each label).   Comparison of Scales       Logarithms were developed initially to manage data that is very large. They are effective for data that grows quickly. Measurement of acidity (pH) and volume (decibel) both use a logarithmic scale. Studies of the human brain indicate that our brains interpret sensory data using a logarithmic scale. For example, a 10 degree temperature change feels like more of change if the initial temperature is F than if it is F.  Logarithms also have a connection to drunk pigeons and a Scotsman's bones.    Definition of Logarithm  The following definition is commonly used for algebraic uses of logarithms. Note that logarithms are defined here as the opposite of an exponential.   Logarithm  if and only if    Each of the following is a conversion between exponential and logarithmic notation.  is the same as .  is the same as .  is the same as .   Write in exponential notation. Confirm that it is true. Using we obtain . By multiplying we confirm it is true.  Write in logarithm notation. Using we obtain .    Graphing Logarithms  Now we will use to analyze the shape of graphs of logarithms.  To practice we will graph . As before we will begin by completing a table. First, consider . This can be re-written as which tells us that . Second, consider . This can be re-written as which tells us that . Because we re-write as it is easiest if the is a power of 2. For example . This tells us that .  Note that this last point shows us that the logarithm grows (vertically) forever. If we want the height to be 100, we select .  This also shows us that the rate of growth is very slow. To increase one unit of height the input must double (because this is base 2).  Consider next the special case . This can be re-written as which tells us that . This is the only place where a logarithm is zero.  Next we will plot points left of . We start with fractions. For we have . This tells us that because negative exponents mean division. Similarly for we have ,so .  Just as the curve grows, slowly forever as increases, these examples show us that it grows forever downward as approaches zero. Notice the y value doubled when we cut the input in half. This means the growth downward is very fast.

First we re-write this log as an exponential. . We know that no exponent will produce a zero, so there is no solution for this.   Re-write as an exponential. Can you find a number for that makes this statement true?    Special Logarithms  Some logarithms occur sufficiently frequently in applications that they have their own notation.  Logarithms were developed to manage large numbers base 10. Thus we call base 10 logarithms: common logs . This is written without the base. For example is the same as .  In science and from mathematics we need another log called the natural logarithm . This is written as (for logarithm natural). Natural logarithms are paired with the base . So is the same as . is a naturally occuring constant. You do not need to memorize an approximation (your calculator can handle that for you). For the curious .    Using technology, calculate  .

Consider that so the remaining two angles have a sum that adds to implying both are smaller.  For right triangles we have names for the sides.

The opposite is the side touching the right angle not touching the angle with which we are working. Note these names are relative to the angle we are considering. That is in the adjacent side for has length 5 and the adjacent side for has length 3. Both the adjacent and opposite are known as legs of the triangle. The hypotenuse is opposite the right angle (the one side not touching it).   Right Triangle Terminology    Similar to this restriction on the lengths of the three sides, there are restrictions on the ratio of side lengths given the measure of the angles. Use the activity in to see how changing either side length or angle affects the other.   The following steps show us that it makes sense to define ratios of side lengths of right triangles. Use the activity in  Use the slider for to increase the angle from to . As the angle increases what does the length of the opposite side (j) do?  Use the slider for to increase the angle from to . As the angle increases what does the length of the adjacent side (j) do?  Note that the hypotenuse does not change in this example. Based on your result in , as the angle increases what will the ratio of opposite to hypotenuse (j\/g) do?  Note that the hypotenuse does not change in this example. Based on your result in , as the angle increases what will the ratio of adjacent to hypotenuse (i\/g) do?  Based on your result in and , as the angle increases what will the ratio of opposite to adjacent (j\/i) do?    Sides vs Angles    Because the ratios are dependent solely on the angle it is reasonable to name and use them. The trigonometric functions (names for the ratios) are in   Trig Functions as Ratios   sine  cosine  tangent  secant  cosecant  cotangent     Right Triangle with Side Lengths     Given the side lengths in what are each of the following trig ratios?  From the perspective of , the side of length 3 is opposite. The hypotenuse has length . Thus  From the perspective of , the side of length 5 is adjacent. The hypotenuse has length . Thus  flips the ratio of (from the previous problem). Thus  From the perspective of , the side of length 5 is opposite. The hypotenuse has length . Thus   Defining the trigonometric functions via ratios has an inherent limitation.   Consider a right triangle with side lengths 8, 15, and 17. If is the angle across from 8, then .  Next consider a right triangle with side lengths 16, 30, and 34. If is the angle across from 16, then . This is the same ratio as the previous triangle although the triangle is larger (double in each side length).  Trigonometric functions are ratios which implies that they do not contain information about scale.   It is also possible to find the angle given the ratio. We use the so called inverse trigonometric functions for this. There are two common notations for them which are shown in .   Inverse Trigonometric Functions   Trig Inverse Trig       Note the notation shows up on calculator keys and in many books. It is unfortunately easy to confuse with . The relationship between and will not be used in this chapter. Be careful to read the full context of any problem. Your calculator does not have a button for and probably not for . For those you use the button, that is, calculate the first then invert.   What is the measure of both non-right angles in ?  We can use the arcsine function. .  We can use the arccosine function. .    A right triangle has legs of lengths 4 and 8. What are the measures of the non-right angles?  Because we have the two legs, we can use the arctangent function to calculate the angles.  Because we have two legs, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the third side length, then use arcsine.  Notice that the larger angle is slightly different from the first solution. This is the result of using the approximate hypotenuse.     If the leg lengths of a right triangle are 6 and 9, what are the measures of the angles?  Angle opposite side length 6:  Angle opposite side length 9:                   Solving Triangles  Our goal now is to use partial information about a triangle to find the rest.   Right Triangle with Labels     If and the hypotenuse has length 13, what is the length of the adjacent side?  Sine is opposite over hypotenuse. Because we know the hypotenuse is 13 this ratio tells us the opposite is 12. Now we are looking for the length of the adjacent.     If and the opposite side for has length 14.00, what are the lengths of the other sides?    Sine is opposite over hypotenuse so, we can setup a proportion. The hypotenuse has length 50.00. The adjacent has length 48.00.        For a right triangle if what is the length of the adjacent?             For a right triangle if , what are the two, non-right angles?  We can use for angle . This is . For the second angle we have three options. First we can use the angle sum.  Another option is to recognize that 12\/13 is adjacent over hypotenuse for the third angle. Thus it is given by .  It is also possible to use the third side. We know from that the third side length is 5. Thus the angle is given by .  We can select a favorite method in cases like these.     For a right triangle with angle and opposite side length 7, what are the other side lengths and angles? All numbers given are exact.    Because sine is opposite over hypotenuse and we know both the angle and opposite, we can calculate the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse has length 9.13. Next we calculate the length of the adjacent. The adjacent has length 5.86. Finally, we know that two of the angles are and , so the third angle has measure .      If a triangle has a leg of length 7 and hypotenuse of length 10, what is the length of the other side and what are the measures of the angles?  Length of other leg:  Angle opposite side length 7:  Angle opposite other leg:                         Use the Pythagorean Theorem and angle sum fact to calculate side lengths and angles.

Calculating lengths using trig functions   Angle of Elevation  The angle of elevation of an object or observation is the angle measured from level (often the ground) up to the object (or line of sight).    Angle of Depression  The angle of depression of an object or observation is the angle measured from level down to the object (or line of sight).    For safety reasons the optimal angle of elevation of a ladder is . If the ladder is 16' long, at what height will the top of the ladder be resting against a wall?   First, we notice that the ladder forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with the ground and the wall. Because we know an angle, the length of the hypotenuse, and we want the length opposite the angle, we want to use the sine function.  Thus the optimal distance to place the base of the ladder is 15.5 feet from the wall.     The shadow of a tree is measured to be 103 ft (measured from the tree to the end of the shadow). From the end of the shadow the angle of elevation to the sun is measured to be . How tall is the tree?  This forms a right triangle with angle , adjacent length 103 ft, and we want the length of the opposite leg. The tree is approximately 200 feet high.    Aircraft typically fly a angle of depression to a point 1020 ft from the start of the runway. How high would the plane be when it crosses the runway.  This is a right triangle with adjacent leg length 1020 ft and angle . The length of the opposite is the height at the threshold.

Because we know an angle, the length of the hypotenuse, and we want the length opposite the angle, we want to use the sine function.  Thus the optimal distance to place the base of the ladder is 15.5 feet from the wall.   "

Here we learn some relationships that do not require any angle to be a right angle.  Note the one relationship that did not require a right angle is the angle sum property .    Law of Sines  In we saw that there was a relationship between angles of a triangle and the side ratios. More generally there is a relationship between an angle of a triangle and the side opposite it. Note that this property is a proportion.   Law of Sines  For a triangle with angles and sides as labeled in ,     Labeled Triangle     A triangle has an angle that is which is opposite a side of length 6. It has another angle that is .  What is the length of the side opposite the angle? According to the law of sines   What is the third angle and the length of the side opposite it? We can use the angle sum fact to calculate the third angle. so . The side length can be calculated using the law of sines.     A triangle has an angle of measure . The side opposite it is length 5.

  "body": " Sine Wave Properties   We began by looking at trigonometric functions in the context of triangles where they represent the ratio of side lengths. Here we will consider trigonometric functions in the context of their graphs which have direct application.    Beyond Triangles  In triangles every angle had to be less than because the sum of the angles of a triangle are only . However, in many applications rather than measuring angles on objects we are measuring how far or how many times around something has moved. Use to explore this idea.    Use the the illustration in to see how angles are measured and how the trig functions act on larger angles. Find each of the following.   Angles of measure and What is the sine value for both points? Compare the x coordinates of these two points. Where is the triangle created by the angle ?  Angles of measure and What is the sine value for both points? Compare the sine values for these two points. Where is the triangle created by the angle ?  Angles of measure and Compare the sine values for these two points. Where is the triangle created by the angle ? Note the angle displayed at the origin for : why does it not match the slider angle?  Angles of measure and Where are the triangles for these two points? Move the slider from to . Which direction does the point move? Note the angle displayed at the origin: explain why it is reasonable.    Bigger Angles    We can use the definition of sine as a ratio and this understanding of angles to produce a graph. In drag the slider until you have the full graph. A graph that extends over a longer range (and labeled in degrees) is in .   Produce Graph of Sine      Properties of Sine Waves   Graph of Sine    Notice that the graph of sine is a wave that repeats. The piece that repeats is called a cycle . In the default graph this is from to as shown in .  The length of the cycle can be modified. Depending on the application we interpret and measure the length of the cycle differently.   Period  The length of a cycle measured in time is called the period .    Wavelength  The length of a cycle measured in distance is called the wavelength .    Sometimes instead of measuring how long a single cycle is units of time, we measure how many cycles occur in a fixed unit of time. This is called frequency .   Frequency  The number of waves (periods) that occur per second is called the frequency . This is typically measured in Hertz (Hz). 1 Hz is one cycle per second.   Note that frequency is the inverse of the period as shown in   Period and Frequency are Inverses   Period Frequency      If a wave has a period of seconds, what is its frequency?  We can see how many of a second there are in one second. That is The frequency is 3.  We can consider this a conversion of units. If the period is and frequency is in cycles per second we can invert the measure.   Generally, if the period is then the frequency is   What are the period and wavelength of middle C which has frequency 261.63 Hz?  Because we know the frequency we can directly calculate the period.  For the wavelength we need to recall the speed of sound is 1116 feet\/second. Now we can use the fact that Hz is cycles per second to convert frequency (cycles per second) to wavelength (feet per cycle).    A local AM radio station broadcasts at Hz. Note radio wave move at the speed of light which is approximately meters per second. What are the period and wavelength of this radio signal?  Because we know the frequency we can directly calculate the period.  For the wavelength we need to convert units from seconds per cycle to meters per cycle      Consider a D which has frequency 293.66 Hz  What is the period?  What is the wavelength?             Because we know the frequency we can directly calculate the period.   For the wavelength we need to recall the speed of sound is 1116 feet\/second. Now we can use the fact that Hz is cycles per second to convert frequency (cycles per second) to wavelength (feet per cycle).         Amplitude  The height of the wave (from center to top) is called the amplitude .     The amplitude of this sine wave is 2. The period is 180. Note without a context period and wavelength are the same. The frequency is     Transformations of Sine  In and we learned how to transform a graph by shifting it and reflecting it. Those apply to trigonometric graphs as well. Here we will learn to change the amplitude and the frequency of sine waves.   Amplitude and Wavelength    Use to answer the following. Note the amplitude of the unmodified graph is 1. If you set , that is graph what is the amplitude? If you set , that is graph what is the amplitude? How could you obtain an amplitude of 1\/2?
