<title>Representing Data</title>

<introduction>

<p>We often represent numerical data using diagrams. These include various kinds of charts like bar graphs and pie charts, and graphing of functions. We do this to make certain traits of the data easier to notice. Here we will look at how some of these are produced and begin to learn to recognize differences due to rates.</p>

		<title>Increasing Income</title>

		<statement><p>When Vasya was hired in 2017 she was paid an annual salary of $62,347.23. Her work has been good, so each year she has received raises of $5000.00.</p>
		<p>To represent this data we first need to calculate her salary each year. We calculate this by iteratively adding the $5000 for each year. This is found in <xref ref="table-graphing-bar1" /></p>
		<p>We will represent her salary over time using the bar graph in <xref ref="figure-graphing-bar1" />. Notice the horizontal axis is labeled with years and the vertical axis is labeled in dollars. There is one bar for each year, because her salary was changed only once each year.</p>
		<p><ul>

		<statement><p>One of the purposes of graphing is to compare how data is changing. Here we will compare the way the raises for Vasya and Tien were calculated.</p>

		<p>Notice that Tien's raises were not the same amount each year. How did the raises change? Vasya's raises were the same each year, so her salary changed by a constant amount. When the rate of change is constant we call the pattern linear. We will learn other patterns.</p>

	<p>Because the salaries changed only once per year we could use a single entry each year. For other data the changes occur constantly.</p>

This would be <m>1.72 \cdot 144 = 247.68</m> inches on the actual shuttle.</p>

		<statement><p>Ohm's Law relates three properties of electricity: voltage, current, and resistance. Voltage is analagous to the amount of pressure to move the electrons.

		<p>The relationship is <me>V = IR</me> where <m>V</m> is voltage (in units of Volts), <m>I</m> is current (in units of amps), and <m>R</m> is the resistance (in units of Ohms).</p>

	<title>Representing Linear Relations</title>

	<p>We have seen what linear data looks like in data tables, discrete graphs (e.g., bar graph), and continuous graphs. Here we will add a representation in mathematical symbols that are useful for calculation.</p>

	<example xml:id="example-graphing-linear-equation">
		<title>Equation for Vasya</title>

		<statement><p>Remember from <xref ref="example-graphing-bar1" /> that Vasya's annual salary follows a linear pattern. Specifically it increases $5000.00 per year. That means in over one year it has increased $5000.00. Over two years it has increased
		<md>
			<mrow>\$5000.00 + \$5000.00 &amp; =</mrow>
			<mrow>2 \cdot \$5000.00 &amp; = \$10,000.00.</mrow>

			<mrow>3 \cdot \$5000.00 &amp; = \$15,000.00.</mrow>
		</md>
		Generally then we can say that after <m>n</m> years, Vasya's salary has increased <m>5000n</m> dollars. To know her actual salary we need to add her initial salary. An equation for Vasya's salary then is <me>S = \$62,347.23 + \$5000.00 n</me>.</p></statement>

	<p>In <xref ref="example-vary-continuous" /> we graphed a line. In terms of the graph of a line, the rate of change is known as the <term>slope</term>. Because the rate of change is constant, the slope can be calculated from any two points.</p>

	<p>Note a rate is a ratio of changes. In terms of points expressed in Cartesian coordinates the calculation is <me>\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</me>. This is read, <q>change in y divided by change in x.</q></p>
